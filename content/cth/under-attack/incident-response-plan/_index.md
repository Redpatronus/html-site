{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Identify the Incident

- Monitor alerts and logs for unusual activities
- Check security tools, logs, or user reports
- Classify the incident severity:
    - ðŸŸ¢ Low: Minor issue, no impact
    - ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Some users affected, partial system impact
    - ðŸ”´ High: Full outage, security breach, data compromise

ðŸ“Œ Tools to use:
- Firewall logs
- Cloud monitoring (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

### ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Activate the Incident Response Team (IRT)

âœ… Notify the right team immediately
âœ… Assign an Incident Manager to take control
âœ… Communicate the issue to leadership & key stakeholders
âœ… Set up a dedicated incident Slack/Teams/War Room

ðŸ“Œ Key Contacts:
- Security Team: (Email, Phone)
- IT Operations: (Email, Phone)
- Legal & Compliance: (Email, Phone)
- Public Relations (PR) Team: (If external communication is needed)

### Step 3: Contain the Threat

âœ… Block malicious traffic, isolate affected systems
âœ… Reset compromised accounts and enforce MFA
âœ… Disable access to vulnerable endpoints
âœ… Apply temporary patches or firewall rules

ðŸ“Œ Emergency actions:
- Stop affected services (systemctl stop <service>)
- Lock compromised user accounts (passwd -l <user>)
- Network segmentation: block traffic from affected IPs

### Step 4: Investigate the Root Cause

âœ… Gather logs from affected systems:
```
journalctl -u <service> --since "1 hour ago"
```
âœ… Review security logs (SIEM, IDS/IPS, WAF)
âœ… Check for unauthorized access or file changes
âœ… Analyze compromised accounts, leaked credentials
