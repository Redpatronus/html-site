### Summary
IBM Cognos Controller versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.1 FP3 and 11.1.0 is vulnerable to unrestricted deserialization. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the unrestricted deserialization of types within the application.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.8
- **Exploitability Score**: 3.9
- **Impact Score**: 5.9
- **Exploitable**: True

### Details
CVE-2024-28777 is an unrestricted deserialization vulnerability affecting IBM Cognos Controller. Deserialization is the process of converting serialized data back into an object. When deserialization is unrestricted, it means the application doesn't properly validate the source or type of the serialized data. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious serialized data, which, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code on the server.  The vulnerability exists in versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.1 FP3 and 11.1.0. Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

### Remediation
The recommended remediation strategy is to upgrade to a patched version of IBM Cognos Controller.  Specifically:

*   **Upgrade to a fixed version:** IBM has released fixed versions of Cognos Controller that address this vulnerability. Users should upgrade to the latest available version or apply the specific patch that resolves CVE-2024-28777. Check IBM's security bulletins and support pages for the official fix.
*   **Apply security best practices:** Enforce least privilege principles for user accounts. Regularly review and update security configurations.
*   **Monitor and Log:** Implement robust monitoring and logging practices to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   **Keep up to date**: Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.

**Important:** Check IBM's official security advisory for the specific patch or upgrade version that addresses this vulnerability, as well as any specific configuration changes that might be required.
