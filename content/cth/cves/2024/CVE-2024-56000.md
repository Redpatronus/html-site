### Summary
Incorrect Privilege Assignment vulnerability in NotFound K Elements allows Privilege Escalation. This issue affects K Elements: from n/a through n/a.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.8
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The K Elements application suffers from an Incorrect Privilege Assignment vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to escalate their privileges within the system. The specific mechanism through which this escalation is achieved is not detailed in the provided information, but it stems from improper assignment or management of user privileges within the application. Because the exploitability score is 0.0, it is likely that the attack requires local or internal access to the system and that exploitation is complex.

### Remediation
Due to the lack of specific details about the vulnerability, the remediation strategy is necessarily general. The following steps are recommended:

1.  **Apply the Patch:** Check for and immediately apply any patches or updates released by the vendor (NotFound) to address this specific vulnerability. This is the most direct way to resolve the issue.
2.  **Review Privilege Assignments:** Carefully review the current privilege assignments within K Elements. Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks. Look for any overly permissive assignments that could be exploited.
3.  **Implement Least Privilege Principle:** Enforce the principle of least privilege. This means that users should only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions.
4.  **Monitor User Activity:** Implement robust monitoring and logging of user activity, especially actions related to privilege management and sensitive data access. This will help detect any potential unauthorized activity or privilege escalation attempts.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of K Elements to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities, including privilege escalation issues.
6.  **Consult Vendor Documentation:** Refer to the vendor's (NotFound) documentation for specific guidance on securing K Elements and managing user privileges.
