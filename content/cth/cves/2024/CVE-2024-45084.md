### Summary
IBM Cognos Controller 11.0.0 through 11.0.1 FP3 and IBM Controller 11.1.0 could allow an authenticated attacker to conduct formula injection. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of file contents.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 8.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 2.1
- **Impact Score**: 5.9
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
CVE-2024-45084 describes a formula injection vulnerability in IBM Cognos Controller. Specifically, versions 11.0.0 up to and including 11.0.1 FP3, as well as version 11.1.0, are affected. An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious formulas into uploaded files. The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of the file contents, which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system. This could potentially lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service. The exploitability score is relatively low because it requires authentication, limiting the pool of potential attackers. However, the impact score is high due to the potential for significant damage if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.

### Remediation
To mitigate the risk associated with CVE-2024-45084, the following remediation strategy is recommended:

1.  **Apply the Fix**: Upgrade to a version of IBM Cognos Controller that addresses this vulnerability.  Refer to IBM's security bulletin and fix packs for the specific Controller version to determine the correct upgrade path.  The fix should include enhanced file validation to prevent formula injection attacks. Contact IBM support for guidance.
2.  **Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation on all file uploads, especially for file types that can contain formulas (e.g., spreadsheets, CSV files). Sanitize and validate file contents to prevent the execution of malicious code.
3.  **Least Privilege**: Ensure that the IBM Cognos Controller application runs with the least privileges necessary. This limits the impact of a successful attack.
4.  **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual file uploads or attempts to execute commands on the system.
5.  **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the IBM Cognos Controller environment.
