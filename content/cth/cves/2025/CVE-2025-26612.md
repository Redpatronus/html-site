- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
CVE-2025-26612 details a critical SQL Injection vulnerability found in WeGIA version prior to 3.2.13. The vulnerability resides within the `adicionar_almoxarife.php` file. An attacker could exploit this flaw by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, potentially leading to database compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized modification of data. The vulnerability is rated as critical due to the high potential for impact and the relative ease with which it can be exploited if the system is vulnerable.

### Remediation
The primary and recommended remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.13 or later**. This version includes a patch that addresses the SQL Injection vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of remediation steps:

1.  **Backup:** Before applying any updates, create a full backup of the WeGIA application, including the database and application files. This ensures you can revert to a previous state if any issues arise during the upgrade process.

2.  **Upgrade:** Download the latest version (3.2.13 or later) of WeGIA from the official source (if available, otherwise the vendor or trusted repository). Follow the upgrade instructions provided in the WeGIA documentation or release notes.

3.  **Verification:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the WeGIA application to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected and that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed. Pay specific attention to areas involving user input and database interaction.

4.  **Monitoring:** Implement security monitoring and logging to detect any suspicious activity that might indicate an attempted exploit.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** As an added layer of protection, consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the WeGIA application. A WAF can help to identify and block malicious requests, including SQL injection attempts, even before they reach the application server. However, a WAF should not be considered a replacement for patching the underlying vulnerability.
