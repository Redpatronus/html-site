## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26612 - WeGIA SQL Injection

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-26612, a SQL Injection vulnerability in the WeGIA application.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in `adicionar_almoxarife.php`
*   **Affected Application:** WeGIA - Web Manager for Institutions
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `adicionar_almoxarife.php`
*   **Description:** A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `adicionar_almoxarife.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or even complete system compromise.
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-26612

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Based on the provided data)
*   **Severity Rating:** Critical
*   **Justification:** A CVSS score of 10.0 indicates the highest possible severity. SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to complete compromise of the application and its underlying database. Unauthorized access to sensitive information is virtually guaranteed with successful exploitation.

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   **Exploit Availability:** While the provided data does not explicitly state the existence of a public exploit, the nature of SQL Injection vulnerabilities often makes them relatively easy to exploit once the vulnerability is understood. Given the critical severity, it should be assumed that an exploit is possible and may be developed rapidly.
*   **Exploit Scenario:** An attacker could manipulate input parameters to the `adicionar_almoxarife.php` endpoint (e.g., through a web form or API call) to inject malicious SQL code. This code would then be executed by the database, potentially granting the attacker access to sensitive data, allowing data modification, or potentially leading to remote code execution on the database server.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary and recommended remediation is to upgrade to the patched version of WeGIA:

*   **Immediate Action:** **Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 or later.** This version contains the fix for the SQL Injection vulnerability.  This is the **only** officially recommended solution.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible):**

*   **Important Note:** Mitigation measures are **not a replacement** for patching the vulnerability. They are temporary measures to reduce the risk while planning and executing the upgrade.

    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rule:** Deploy or update a WAF rule set to detect and block SQL injection attempts targeting the `adicionar_almoxarife.php` endpoint.  The WAF rule should look for common SQL injection patterns.  This is a complex task and requires understanding of SQL injection techniques. It's likely the most useful temporary measure.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Difficult to Implement as a Mitigation):** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all input parameters to the `adicionar_almoxarife.php` endpoint.  This involves:
        *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow known good characters and formats for input values.
        *   **Escaping:** Properly escape special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL code.  This is very complex in practice.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Ensure the database user account used by the WeGIA application has only the necessary privileges to perform its intended functions.  Restrict access to sensitive tables and operations. While this won't prevent the injection, it may limit the scope of the damage an attacker can inflict.
    *   **Monitor and Audit:** Implement thorough monitoring and auditing of database activity, particularly for queries originating from the WeGIA application. Look for suspicious patterns that may indicate a SQL injection attempt.

**6. Verification:**

*   **Post-Upgrade Verification:** After upgrading to version 3.2.13, thoroughly test the `adicionar_almoxarife.php` endpoint to confirm that the SQL Injection vulnerability has been successfully addressed. Use penetration testing tools and techniques to simulate an attack.
*   **WAF Rule Verification (If applicable):** Verify that the deployed WAF rules are effectively blocking SQL injection attempts.  Monitor WAF logs for blocked requests.

**7. Communication:**

*   **Internal Communication:** Communicate this vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation strategy to all relevant stakeholders, including IT staff, developers, and security personnel.
*   **User Communication:**  Inform users of the WeGIA application about the importance of keeping their software up-to-date.

**8. Timeline:**

*   **Upgrade to version 3.2.13:** As soon as possible. This is the highest priority.
*   **Implement Mitigation Measures (If necessary):** Within 24-48 hours of discovery.
*   **Verification:** Immediately after upgrading and implementing mitigation measures.

**Disclaimer:**

This remediation/mitigation strategy is based on the limited information provided in the vulnerability report.  A thorough security assessment and penetration testing are recommended to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities in the WeGIA application.
