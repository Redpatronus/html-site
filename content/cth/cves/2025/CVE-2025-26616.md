### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A Path Traversal vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `exportar_dump.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in `config.php`. `config.php` contains information that could allow direct access to the database. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability, present in the `exportar_dump.php` file of WeGIA, allows for Path Traversal. An attacker can manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory, specifically targeting the `config.php` file. This file contains sensitive information, including database credentials.  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability grants unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.  The vulnerability is resolved in version 3.2.14. While the exploitability score is reported as 0.0, indicating a lack of easily available exploits *at the time of the report*, the underlying vulnerability is severe due to the potential impact. The CVE details page suggests that an access vector is "Local", and the Access Complexity is "Low" meaning the attacker needs local access and the attack can be performed easily.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later**. This version contains the fix for the Path Traversal vulnerability.

**Steps:**

1.  **Backup your WeGIA installation:** Before applying any updates, create a complete backup of your WeGIA installation, including the database and all files. This is crucial to ensure you can restore your system if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
2.  **Download the latest version:** Download WeGIA version 3.2.14 or a later version from the official WeGIA website or the project's GitHub repository.
3.  **Follow the upgrade instructions:** Refer to the official WeGIA documentation for detailed instructions on how to upgrade the application. This may involve replacing existing files, running database migrations, or other specific steps.
4.  **Verify the upgrade:** After the upgrade is complete, thoroughly test the application to ensure it is functioning correctly and that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed.

**Additional Security Best Practices:**

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your WeGIA installation and associated infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that all users and processes have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect your WeGIA installation from common web attacks, including Path Traversal attempts.
