#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0


### Details 
CVE-2025-26616 describes a critical Path Traversal vulnerability found in WeGIA versions prior to 3.2.14. The vulnerability exists within the `exportar_dump.php` script. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can manipulate the file paths used by the script, potentially allowing them to read sensitive files outside of the intended directory. Specifically, the vulnerability allows access to `config.php`, a file which stores sensitive database credentials. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability grants an attacker complete access to the database, which could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and other severe consequences. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this vulnerability is CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). Because the exploitability score is 0.0 and Impact Score is 0.0 there is a problem with the vulnerability.

### Remediation
The primary and recommended remediation strategy is to upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later. This version contains the fix for the path traversal vulnerability in `exportar_dump.php`.

**Steps for Remediation:**

1.  **Backup:** Before performing any upgrade, create a complete backup of your WeGIA installation, including the application files and the database. This will allow you to restore the system in case of any issues during the upgrade process.
2.  **Upgrade WeGIA:** Download the latest version (3.2.14 or later) from the official WeGIA repository or website. Follow the upgrade instructions provided with the new version. This usually involves replacing the existing application files with the new ones and running any necessary database migrations.
3.  **Verify:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the WeGIA installation to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected. Specifically, verify that access to sensitive files and directories is properly restricted.
4.  **Monitor:** Continuously monitor the WeGIA installation for any signs of suspicious activity. Implement security measures such as intrusion detection systems and log analysis to detect and respond to potential attacks.

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Upgrading to the fixed version is the only effective way to mitigate the risk.
