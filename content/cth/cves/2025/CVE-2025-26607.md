### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `documento_excluir.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.13 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 10.0
- **Impact Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitable**: True

### Details 
According to CVE details, the vulnerability lies in the `documento_excluir.php` file within the WeGIA application. Unsanitized user input passed to this file is directly incorporated into SQL queries. This allows a remote attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input parameters, potentially leading to:
*   Data Breach: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data stored in the database.
*   Privilege Escalation: Potentially gaining elevated privileges within the application.
*   System Compromise: In severe cases, depending on the database server configuration and permissions, achieving code execution on the underlying server.

### Remediation

The primary and most effective remediation strategy is to upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.13 or later. This version includes the necessary fixes to prevent SQL injection in the vulnerable `documento_excluir.php` endpoint.

**Steps to remediate:**

1.  **Upgrade to version 3.2.13 or later:** Download the latest version from the official WeGIA repository or website and follow the upgrade instructions provided.
2.  **Verify the fix:** After upgrading, test the `documento_excluir.php` functionality with potentially malicious input to confirm that the SQL injection vulnerability has been resolved.
3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** While upgrading is the definitive solution, consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as a temporary mitigation measure if an immediate upgrade is not possible. Configure the WAF with rules to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns. Note that this is not a replacement for patching the underlying vulnerability.
4.  **Database Access Control:** Review and enforce strict database access controls. Limit the database user account used by WeGIA to only the necessary privileges required for its operation. Avoid granting unnecessary permissions that could be exploited in the event of a successful SQL injection attack.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the WeGIA application and its infrastructure.
