### Summary
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in NotFound Distance Rate Shipping for WooCommerce allows Blind SQL Injection. This issue affects Distance Rate Shipping for WooCommerce: from n/a through 1.3.4.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 8.5
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
CVE-2025-22639 describes a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability within the NotFound Distance Rate Shipping for WooCommerce plugin, affecting versions up to and including 1.3.4.  The vulnerability stems from inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in SQL queries.  An attacker could exploit this to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Due to the nature of Blind SQL Injection, an attacker may not see direct output from the database, but can infer results by observing application behavior (e.g., timing differences) based on injected SQL conditions. The exploitability score indicates that exploitation may be complex or require specific conditions to be met, and may not be easily automated.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to **update the Distance Rate Shipping for WooCommerce plugin to a patched version that addresses the SQL injection vulnerability.**  Contact the plugin vendor (NotFound) to inquire about a patched version and apply the update immediately upon release.

If an update is not yet available, consider the following mitigations:

*   **Disable the plugin:** Temporarily disabling the plugin will eliminate the risk associated with the vulnerability.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:** Implement or update existing WAF rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts targeting the affected plugin.  Specifically, focus on rules that identify common SQL injection patterns and keywords.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While this should be handled by the plugin developers, review any custom code interacting with the plugin and ensure rigorous input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Database Access Control:** Ensure that the WordPress database user account used by the plugin has the minimum necessary privileges to perform its intended functions. This will limit the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

Regularly monitor the plugin vendor's website and security advisories for updates and further guidance.
