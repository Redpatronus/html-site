### Summary
Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to the nature of user-submitted code execution. By loading a module containing malicious code and running the associated command, an attacker can extract the bot token. This can then be used to perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, impersonate the bot, and potentially gain full control if the bot has high privileges.  Any Discord user that hosts Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel before commit f0d9e70841a0e3170b88c4f8d562018ccd8e8b14 is affected. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to limit their discord bot's access via configuration options.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 8.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability stems from the Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel's architecture which allows execution of arbitrary user-supplied code. This design flaw can be exploited by malicious actors through the following steps:

1.  An attacker crafts a malicious module containing code designed to extract the bot token.
2.  The attacker loads this module into the Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel.
3.  Upon execution of the command associated with the malicious module, the bot token is exposed.
4.  The attacker can then leverage the stolen bot token to:
    *   Launch DoS attacks by loading modules that consume excessive resources.
    *   Impersonate the bot, potentially misleading users and performing actions on their behalf.
    *   If the bot has elevated privileges, the attacker gains near-complete control over the bot's functions and potentially the associated Discord server.

The impact is significant, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and compromised user trust.

### Remediation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following remediation steps are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade:** Immediately upgrade to a version of Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel that includes the fix in commit f0d9e70841a0e3170b88c4f8d562018ccd8e8b14 or later. This commit addresses the arbitrary code execution issue.
2.  **Restrict Bot Permissions:**  If upgrading is not immediately feasible, carefully review and restrict the bot's Discord permissions to the minimum necessary for its intended function. Avoid granting unnecessary administrative privileges. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they gain control of the bot.
3.  **Review and Sanitize Modules:**  Thoroughly review all existing modules for any potentially malicious code or unintended behavior.  Implement input validation and sanitization measures to prevent code injection attacks. Disable or remove any untrusted modules.
4.  **Implement Code Review Process:** Establish a robust code review process for all new or modified modules before deployment.  This helps identify and prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into the system.
5.  **Monitor Bot Activity:** Implement monitoring and logging of bot activity to detect any suspicious or unauthorized actions. This allows for a rapid response in case of a compromise.
