A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `dependente_docdependente.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `dependente_docdependente.php` file of the WeGIA application.  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through input parameters processed by this script. Due to insufficient input validation and sanitization, the injected SQL code gets executed within the database context, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, or even gain control of the underlying database server. The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 3.2.13.

### Remediation

The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 or later**. This version contains the fix for the identified SQL injection vulnerability.

**Steps for Remediation:**

1.  **Backup your WeGIA database and application files:** Before applying any updates, create a full backup of your WeGIA installation to ensure you can restore the system in case of any issues during the upgrade process.
2.  **Download the latest version:** Download WeGIA version 3.2.13 or a later version from the official WeGIA repository or website.
3.  **Follow the upgrade instructions:** Refer to the official WeGIA upgrade documentation for detailed instructions on how to properly upgrade your installation. This will typically involve replacing the existing application files with the new version and running any necessary database schema updates.
4.  **Verify the installation:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected and that the vulnerability has been successfully mitigated. Pay special attention to the `dependente_docdependente.php` functionality.
5.  **Monitor your system:** Continuously monitor your WeGIA installation for any suspicious activity or signs of exploitation. Implement proper security logging and auditing mechanisms.

Since there are no known workarounds, upgrading is crucial to mitigate this high severity vulnerability.
