### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A Path Traversal vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `examples.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in `config.php`. `config.php` contains information that could allow direct access to the database. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 3.9
- **Impact Score**: 6.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient input sanitization in the `examples.php` file. An attacker can manipulate the request to this file to traverse directories and access the `config.php` file, which contains sensitive database credentials.  This allows for unauthorized database access, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. The lack of proper access controls on the `examples.php` endpoint exacerbates the issue. The path traversal vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that bypasses security measures implemented by the developer, such as using "../" sequences in the file path parameter.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.14 or later**. This version contains a fix that properly sanitizes input and prevents path traversal attacks. If upgrading is not immediately feasible, consider the following mitigation steps (though these are *not* recommended as a complete solution):

1.  **Restrict Access to `examples.php`:** Modify your web server configuration (e.g., Apache's `.htaccess` or Nginx's `nginx.conf`) to restrict access to the `examples.php` file from external sources. Limit access to only authorized administrators or disable the file entirely if it's not essential for your application's functionality. Example Apache configuration:

<Files examples.php>
  Require ip 127.0.0.1  # Allow only localhost
  # OR
  Require valid-user      # Require authentication
</Files>

2.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:** Implement a WAF with rules designed to detect and block path traversal attempts targeting the `examples.php` endpoint. Configure the WAF to inspect incoming requests for suspicious patterns like `../` and block those requests.

3.  **Input Validation Review (If Applicable):** Even if an upgrade to 3.2.14 is planned, review other areas of the WeGIA application for similar input validation vulnerabilities, especially those handling file paths.

**Important Note:** The best and recommended approach is always to upgrade to the patched version to permanently address the vulnerability. The mitigation steps above are temporary measures and might not fully protect against all potential exploits. Ensure a backup of your current WeGIA installation before applying any changes.
