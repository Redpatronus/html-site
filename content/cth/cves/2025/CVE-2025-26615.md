### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A Path Traversal vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `examples.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in `config.php`. `config.php` contains information that could allow direct access to the database. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 3.9
- **Impact Score**: 6.0
- **Exploitable**: 0


### Details 
The Path Traversal vulnerability in the `examples.php` endpoint of WeGIA versions prior to 3.2.14 allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a malicious URL containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`), an attacker can bypass access restrictions and retrieve sensitive files like `config.php`. The `config.php` file typically contains database credentials (username, password, database name) and other sensitive configuration settings.  Successful exploitation grants an attacker direct access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, account compromise, and complete system takeover.

### Remediation
The primary remediation is to upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.14 or later. This version contains a patch that addresses the Path Traversal vulnerability in the `examples.php` endpoint.  

**Steps to Remediate:**

1.  **Backup:** Before upgrading, create a full backup of your WeGIA installation, including the application files, database, and any associated configurations. This ensures you can restore your system to its previous state if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
2.  **Upgrade:** Download WeGIA version 3.2.14 or a later version from the official WeGIA website or repository. Follow the official upgrade instructions provided with the new version. This typically involves replacing the existing application files with the updated ones and running any necessary database migration scripts.
3.  **Verify:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the application to ensure it is functioning correctly. Specifically, verify that the `examples.php` endpoint is no longer vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks. Attempt to access sensitive files using directory traversal sequences in the URL. If the vulnerability has been successfully patched, these attempts should be blocked.
4.  **Monitor:** Continuously monitor your WeGIA installation for any signs of suspicious activity or potential security breaches. Implement security best practices, such as regularly updating software, using strong passwords, and limiting access to sensitive resources.
