## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-1293 in Hermes

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-1293, a critical vulnerability affecting Hermes versions up to 0.4.0.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Improper JWT Validation in AWS ALB Authentication Mode
*   **Affected Software:** Hermes versions up to 0.4.0
*   **Description:** Hermes versions prior to 0.5.0 did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) provided when using the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) authentication mode. This allowed for potential authentication bypass. An attacker could potentially forge or manipulate the JWT to gain unauthorized access to Hermes resources.
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-1293
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.2 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:**  Information provided is insufficient to construct the full CVSS vector.  However, a CVSS score of 8.2 suggests a combination of high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, likely with relatively low attack complexity.

**2. Severity Assessment:**

*   **Severity:** High
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Successful exploitation allows unauthorized access to Hermes resources.
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Potential exposure of sensitive data handled by Hermes.
    *   **Integrity Compromise:**  Possibility of unauthorized modification of Hermes configurations or data.
    *   **Availability Impact:**  Denial of service is possible, depending on the exploited functionality.

**3. Known Exploits:**

*   Based on the description, a common exploit technique would involve crafting a malicious JWT with altered claims (e.g., the user ID or permissions) and presenting it to Hermes.  The lack of proper validation in vulnerable versions would allow the forged JWT to be accepted, granting the attacker access with the permissions specified in the crafted token. While the provided information doesn't detail specific exploit code, the general mechanism is a standard JWT manipulation attack.
*   Without further details from Hashicorp, we can only assume standard JWT manipulation tactics apply.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary remediation strategy is to upgrade to Hermes version 0.5.0 or later.  This version contains the fix for CVE-2025-1293.

*   **Immediate Action: Upgrade Hermes:**
    *   Upgrade all instances of Hermes to version 0.5.0 or later immediately.
    *   Follow the official Hermes upgrade documentation provided by HashiCorp.
    *   Verify the upgrade was successful and the new version is running.

*   **Verification & Validation:**
    *   After upgrading, thoroughly test the AWS ALB authentication functionality to ensure it is working as expected.
    *   Review Hermes logs for any suspicious activity or errors.
    *   Consider penetration testing to validate the fix and identify any other potential vulnerabilities.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (if immediate upgrade is not possible):**

If an immediate upgrade to Hermes 0.5.0 or later is not feasible, implement the following temporary mitigation strategies:

*   **Restrict Access:**
    *   Implement strict network segmentation to limit access to Hermes instances from untrusted networks.
    *   Use strong firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic to Hermes.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules (if applicable):**
    *   If using a WAF, create rules to inspect incoming JWTs for suspicious patterns or invalid signatures.  This can provide an additional layer of protection. *Note: This requires understanding of JWT structure and the expected signing algorithm.*

*   **Monitor Logs:**
    *   Intensify monitoring of Hermes logs for any authentication anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, or suspicious activity.

*   **Disable/Replace ALB authentication (Temporary):**
    *   If feasible, and after thorough testing, consider temporarily disabling ALB authentication and using an alternative, more secure authentication method until the upgrade can be performed.  *Caution: This may significantly impact application availability and integration.*

**6. Long-Term Prevention:**

*   **Patch Management:** Establish a robust patch management process to ensure timely updates to Hermes and other critical infrastructure components.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement regular vulnerability scanning to identify and address potential security issues proactively.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Provide security awareness training to developers and system administrators to educate them on secure coding practices and common security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement and enforce secure configuration baselines for Hermes and other infrastructure components.
*   **Review Authentication Mechanisms Regularly:** Review the chosen authentication method and ensure its robust and appropriate for the security requirements.

**7. Communication:**

*   Communicate the vulnerability and remediation steps to all relevant stakeholders (developers, system administrators, security team).
*   Keep stakeholders informed of the progress of the remediation efforts.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Official Documentation:**  Always refer to the official Hermes documentation from HashiCorp for the most accurate and up-to-date information on security advisories and remediation steps.
*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test all remediation and mitigation steps in a non-production environment before implementing them in production.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Perform a thorough risk assessment to determine the potential impact of the vulnerability and prioritize remediation efforts accordingly.

This strategy is based on the provided information.  More detailed guidance may be available from HashiCorp and should be followed when available.
