## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26610 - WeGIA SQL Injection

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-26610, a SQL Injection vulnerability in the WeGIA application.

### 1. Vulnerability Description

*   **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA Web Manager for Institutions (versions prior to 3.2.13)
*   **Description:** A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows an authorized attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database interactions.  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.

### 2. Severity

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:**  (Based on information provided, an exact vector cannot be constructed. A likely base score of 9.4 suggests network attack vector, high attack complexity, low privileges required, high user interaction not required, Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability all High)
*   **Severity Rating:** Critical
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** High - Unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, institutional data, and potentially financial information.
    *   **Integrity:** High - Ability to modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Availability:** High - Potential to disrupt application availability through database manipulation or denial-of-service attacks.

### 3. Known Exploit Information

*   **Known Exploits:**  As reported, there are no specific exploits publicly documented at the time of the advisory. However, the nature of SQL Injection vulnerabilities is well-understood, and attackers with knowledge of the application and SQL syntax can easily craft exploits.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack. An attacker with valid (though possibly limited) authorization can exploit the vulnerability remotely through HTTP requests to the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint.
*   **Attack Complexity:** Likely Low.  SQL Injection is a relatively well-understood vulnerability. Given valid authorization, exploiting the vulnerability likely requires identifying the vulnerable parameter(s) and crafting appropriate SQL Injection payloads.

### 4. Remediation Strategy

*   **Primary Remediation:** **Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 or later immediately.** The vendor has patched the vulnerability in this version. This is the most effective and permanent solution.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Download the latest version of WeGIA (3.2.13 or later) from the official source.
        2.  Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions.  **Ensure to back up your database and application files *before* starting the upgrade process.**
        3.  Verify that the upgrade was successful and that the vulnerability is no longer present by testing the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint with common SQL Injection payloads. (However, do so in a safe, isolated test environment first.)

### 5. Mitigation Strategy (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible)

If an immediate upgrade to version 3.2.13 is not possible, the following mitigation steps should be implemented *temporarily* to reduce the risk of exploitation:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint. This should include:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and data formats for all input parameters.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Escaping:**  Properly escape all input parameters before they are used in SQL queries. Use the appropriate escaping functions provided by the database system being used (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string` for MySQL).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Review and restrict database user privileges. Ensure that the database user account used by the WeGIA application has the *minimum* necessary privileges to perform its required functions.  This limits the potential impact of a successful SQL Injection attack.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF in front of the WeGIA application and configure it with rules to detect and block SQL Injection attempts.  Regularly update the WAF ruleset to ensure it is effective against the latest attack techniques.
*   **Monitor and Alert:**  Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity on the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint.  Monitor for unusual SQL queries or patterns that might indicate an attempted SQL Injection attack.
*   **Disable/Restrict Access (Worst Case):** If none of the above mitigations can be implemented quickly, consider temporarily disabling the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` functionality or restricting access to it to only trusted users from specific IP addresses until an upgrade can be performed.

### 6. Long-Term Security Measures

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Enforce secure coding practices throughout the WeGIA development lifecycle, including:
    *   Regular security training for developers.
    *   Code reviews to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
    *   Static and dynamic code analysis to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the WeGIA application to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up to date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

### 7. Testing

After implementing the remediation or mitigation steps, thoroughly test the application to ensure that the vulnerability has been addressed and that the application is functioning correctly.  Testing should include:

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner to scan the application for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct manual penetration testing to simulate a real-world attack.
*   **Regression Testing:**  Perform regression testing to ensure that the remediation or mitigation steps have not introduced any new issues.

**Important Note:**  The mitigation steps are temporary measures and should not be considered a substitute for upgrading to the patched version of WeGIA.  Upgrade to version 3.2.13 as soon as possible to permanently address the vulnerability.
