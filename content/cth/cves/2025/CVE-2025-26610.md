A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint. This vulnerability allow an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.13 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.4
- **Exploitability Score**: 2.2
- **Impact Score**: 7.2
- **Exploitable**: Yes

### Details 
According to cvedetails.com, CVE-2025-26610 is a SQL Injection vulnerability in WeGIA version 3.2.12 and earlier. Specifically, the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` script is vulnerable.  An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands via the `id_produto` parameter. This allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and the data it manages.  Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be authenticated to the WeGIA application.

### Remediation

The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.13 or later**.  This version contains a patch that addresses the SQL injection vulnerability.

Steps for remediation:

1.  **Backup your WeGIA database and application files.**  This is crucial to ensure data recovery in case of any issues during the upgrade process.
2.  **Download the latest version (3.2.13 or later) of WeGIA** from the official WeGIA website or the appropriate repository.
3.  **Follow the upgrade instructions provided with the new version.** This usually involves replacing the existing application files with the new ones and running any necessary database migration scripts.
4.  **Verify the upgrade.**  After the upgrade, carefully test the application to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that the vulnerability has been addressed.  Specifically, test the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` endpoint with various inputs to confirm that SQL injection is no longer possible.
5.  **Monitor your system.** Continue to monitor your WeGIA installation for any suspicious activity or errors.

If upgrading is not immediately feasible, consider these temporary mitigation steps *with caution and understanding that they are not substitutes for patching*:

*   **Restrict access:** Limit access to the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` script to only authorized users.  Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF and configure it with rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts.  This can provide an extra layer of protection. However, relying solely on a WAF without patching is not recommended.
*   **Input Validation:**  If possible, add input validation to the `id_produto` parameter of the `restaurar_produto_desocultar.php` script.  Sanitize user input to remove any potentially malicious characters before passing it to the database query. This mitigation is complex and prone to errors if not implemented correctly.  It should only be considered a temporary measure.

**Important Note:**  Applying mitigations without patching the vulnerability leaves the system vulnerable. Prioritize upgrading to version 3.2.13 or later as soon as possible.
