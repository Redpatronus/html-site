### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.1.3.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The BatchWinnerEntry functionality in ChurchCRM directly incorporates the CurrentFundraiser parameter into a SQL query. Due to insufficient input validation and sanitization, an attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious SQL code via the CurrentFundraiser parameter. This injected code can be used to perform various malicious activities, including reading sensitive data, modifying existing data, or even deleting entire database tables. Since the vulnerability is a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection, attackers might need to employ techniques to infer information about the database by observing the server's response time or boolean outputs. The impact is significant due to the potential for complete compromise of the ChurchCRM database.

### Remediation

To mitigate the risk of CVE-2025-1135, the following remediation steps are recommended:

1.  **Apply the Patch:** Upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that addresses this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website or vendor documentation for the latest security patches.
2.  **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter within the BatchWinnerEntry functionality.  Specifically, validate that the input conforms to the expected data type (integer, string, etc.) and length.  Use a whitelist approach where only explicitly allowed values are permitted.
3.  **Parameterized Queries:**  Rewrite the affected SQL query to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user-supplied data, preventing SQL injection attacks.  This is the most effective way to prevent this type of vulnerability.
4.  **Least Privilege:** Review and enforce the principle of least privilege. Restrict administrator access to only those users who require it for their job functions. Implement stricter access control mechanisms to minimize the impact of a compromised administrator account.
5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules configured to detect and block SQL injection attempts. The WAF can provide an additional layer of security by filtering malicious traffic before it reaches the ChurchCRM application.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in ChurchCRM and other applications.
