### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability lies within the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality where the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter is used to construct an SQL query.  Due to the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries, an attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious SQL code into the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter.  This injected code is then executed directly against the database, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as retrieving sensitive data, modifying existing data, or even deleting tables. The blind SQL injection nature of the vulnerability means the attacker might not receive direct feedback from the database, requiring techniques like boolean-based or time-based inference to confirm the success of the injection.

### Remediation
To address this SQL injection vulnerability, the following remediation steps are recommended:

1.  **Update ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses this vulnerability. Check the official ChurchCRM website or security advisories for the latest updates and security patches.  If a patch isn't yet available, consider a temporary workaround (described below) until the official patch is released.

2.  **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation on the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter.  Specifically:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  If possible, define a strict whitelist of allowed characters or values for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter and reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.  This is preferable to blacklisting.
    *   **Escaping Special Characters:**  Properly escape any special characters that could be used to manipulate the SQL query, such as single quotes ('), double quotes ("), semicolons (;), and backslashes (\\). Use database-specific escaping functions for optimal security.

3.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  The most effective way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements). Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data, preventing the injected code from being interpreted as part of the query. Replace the direct concatenation of the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter into the SQL query with a parameterized query.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Even though this vulnerability requires administrator privileges, it's always good practice to review user permissions.  Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.  This will limit the potential damage an attacker can cause if they compromise an account.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests, including SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specific to protecting against SQL injection vulnerabilities.

6.  **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities, including other instances of direct SQL query construction without proper sanitization.

7.  **Temporary Workaround (If no patch is immediately available):**
    *   Disable or restrict access to the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality until a patch is available.
    *   Implement a temporary input validation rule that only allows numeric values for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter.  While not a complete solution, it can mitigate some basic SQL injection attempts.  Remember to replace this with proper sanitization/parameterized queries.
