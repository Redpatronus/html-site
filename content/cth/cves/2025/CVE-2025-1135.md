### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability lies in the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality. Specifically, the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker with administrator privileges can craft malicious SQL queries within the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter. Due to the lack of proper sanitization, the crafted SQL code is executed against the database. This can result in the attacker being able to read sensitive information from the database, modify existing data, or even delete data entirely. The vulnerability is both boolean-based and time-based, which means an attacker can infer information from the database based on true/false conditions or the time it takes for the server to respond to a query. Because administrative privileges are required, successful exploitation requires either a compromised administrator account or a privilege escalation vulnerability.

### Remediation

To mitigate the SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-1135) in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior, the following steps should be taken:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** The most effective solution is to upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM. Check the ChurchCRM website for the latest stable release and security patches.

2.  **Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries:**  Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter (and all other user-supplied inputs) used in SQL queries.  Instead of directly concatenating the input into the SQL query, use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements). Parameterized queries treat the input as data, not executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Review and enforce the principle of least privilege. Ensure that users and administrators only have the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks. This limits the potential damage if an administrator account is compromised.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specific to SQL injection and other common web application attacks.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the ChurchCRM application and infrastructure.

6.  **Database Access Control:** Restrict database access to only the application server running ChurchCRM.  Minimize the number of accounts that have direct access to the database.

7.  **Monitor Logs:** Implement monitoring and logging to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual SQL queries or attempts to access sensitive data.
