### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.1.3 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality within ChurchCRM 5.1.3 and earlier versions is susceptible to SQL injection due to insecure handling of the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter. This parameter, used to filter records related to a specific fundraiser, is directly incorporated into the SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization. An attacker with administrator privileges can manipulate this parameter by injecting malicious SQL code. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass intended database access restrictions, read sensitive data, modify existing records, or even execute arbitrary system commands depending on database configuration. The SQL injection type is boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection.

### Remediation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following steps should be taken:

1.  **Upgrade to the latest version of ChurchCRM:** Check for any newer versions of ChurchCRM beyond 5.1.3 as security patches and upgrades are the primary means of addressing vulnerabilities. Upgrade as soon as possible.
2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter and all other user-supplied inputs that are used in database queries. Employ parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Review and enforce the principle of least privilege. Limit the database user's permissions to the minimum required for application functionality.  Do not grant database user the SUPER privilege.
4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and configure it with rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts. This provides an additional layer of protection.
5.  **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality and any other areas where user input interacts with the database. Look for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
6. **Disable Unnecessary Functionality:**  If the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality is not actively being used, consider disabling it or removing it entirely to eliminate the attack vector. This is a temporary measure until the code can be properly patched.
