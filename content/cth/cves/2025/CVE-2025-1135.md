### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The BatchWinnerEntry functionality in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior versions is susceptible to SQL injection. Specifically, the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter is vulnerable.  This parameter is used to construct an SQL query without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker with Administrator privileges can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter.  Due to the blind nature of the injection (boolean and time-based), the attacker may not receive direct output from the database but can infer results based on the response time or boolean conditions of the injected query. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the entire ChurchCRM database.

### Remediation
To mitigate the SQL injection vulnerability, the following remediation steps should be implemented:

1.  **Update to a patched version:** Upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a fix for CVE-2025-1135. Check the ChurchCRM official website or security advisories for the latest patched version.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter within the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. This includes:
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a whitelist of allowed characters and formats for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Escaping Special Characters:** Properly escape any special characters in the input string that are used in SQL queries.  Use parameterized queries to prevent interpretation of user-supplied data as SQL code.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate that the input adheres to the expected format.

3.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Replace direct string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized queries or prepared statements. Parameterized queries ensure that user-provided data is treated as data and not as executable code, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** While the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges, review and restrict user privileges to the minimum necessary for each user's role. This reduces the potential impact if an administrator account is compromised.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting the vulnerable functionality.  Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to prevent SQL injection attacks.

6.  **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the BatchWinnerEntry functionality to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of the implemented remediation measures and identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

8. **Monitor logs:** Regularly review application logs for suspicious activity or SQL errors that may indicate attempted exploitation.
