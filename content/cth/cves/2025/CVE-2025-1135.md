### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability lies within the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality of ChurchCRM. The `CurrentFundraiser` parameter, when processing batch entries, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.  This allows an attacker, who has already gained Administrator privileges, to inject malicious SQL code through the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter. By crafting specific payloads, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords, financial information), modify existing records, or even delete data from the database.  The attack leverages boolean and time-based blind SQL injection techniques, meaning the attacker might not see direct output from the database but can infer results based on the timing and success of different queries. Successful exploitation can completely compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the ChurchCRM database.

### Remediation
To mitigate this SQL injection vulnerability, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM**: The most effective solution is to upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a fix for this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website for the latest version and security patches.
2.  **Input Sanitization**: Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user-supplied data, especially the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter within the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL queries. This will ensure that user-provided values are treated as data, not as SQL code.
3.  **Least Privilege Principle**: Review and enforce the principle of least privilege. Limit the database user permissions used by ChurchCRM to only those necessary for its operation.  Do not grant the database user administrative privileges if they are not required.
4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to protect against SQL injection attacks.
5.  **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough code review of the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities. Ensure that all SQL queries are properly parameterized and that user input is validated.
6.  **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the ChurchCRM installation to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
7. **Database Auditing:** Enable database auditing to track all database access and modifications.  This will help in detecting and investigating any suspicious activity.
