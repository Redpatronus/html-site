### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based and time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the BatchWinnerEntry functionality. The CurrentFundraiser parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Please note the vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter within the `BatchWinnerEntry` functionality of ChurchCRM. This parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query, creating an opportunity for SQL injection attacks. An attacker with administrator privileges can craft malicious SQL code within the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter, which is then executed by the database server. This allows the attacker to bypass intended security constraints and manipulate the database, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure, unauthorized data modification, or even complete database compromise. The SQL injection is boolean-based and time-based blind, meaning the attacker might not see direct output from the queries but can infer results based on the response time or success/failure of other operations.

### Remediation
To mitigate the SQL injection vulnerability, the following remediation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a patch for this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website or release notes for the latest version and security updates.

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter (and all other user-supplied inputs). This includes:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  If possible, validate the `CurrentFundraiser` parameter against a predefined whitelist of allowed values.
    *   **Escaping:** Properly escape any special characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands.  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

3.  **Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements:** The most effective solution is to refactor the affected code to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This separates the SQL code from the user-supplied data, preventing the database from interpreting the data as SQL commands.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** While the vulnerability requires administrative privileges, ensure that administrative access is granted only to users who absolutely require it. Review and restrict access as needed.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with appropriate rules to protect against common SQL injection patterns.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your ChurchCRM installation.

7.  **Database Permissions:** Review and restrict database permissions to limit the impact of a successful SQL injection attack. Ensure that the database user used by ChurchCRM has only the necessary privileges.
