### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `historico_paciente.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0


### Details 
The SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint of WeGIA. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are used to construct database queries.  Due to insufficient input validation and sanitization, the injected SQL code is executed by the application's database server. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms, retrieve sensitive data from the database (including user credentials, patient records, and other confidential information), modify data, or even potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The vulnerability is classified as critical due to the high potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Successful exploitation does not require authentication, making it easily exploitable if the vulnerable instance is accessible. Affected versions are prior to 3.2.14.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later. This version contains the necessary security patch to address the SQL injection vulnerability in `historico_paciente.php`. To upgrade:

1.  **Backup Your Database:** Before performing any updates, create a full backup of your WeGIA database. This ensures that you can restore your data in case of any issues during the upgrade process.
2.  **Download the Latest Version:** Download WeGIA version 3.2.14 or a later version from the official WeGIA repository or website.
3.  **Follow the Upgrade Instructions:** Refer to the official WeGIA documentation for detailed instructions on how to upgrade the application. This usually involves replacing the existing application files with the new version and running any necessary database migration scripts.
4.  **Verify the Installation:** After the upgrade is complete, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected. Pay special attention to the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint and related areas to confirm that the SQL injection vulnerability has been resolved.
5. **Implement Web Application Firewall(WAF)**. You can implement WAF that can protect the application at edge.
