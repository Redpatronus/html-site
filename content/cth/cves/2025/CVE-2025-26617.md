## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26617 - WeGIA SQL Injection

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-26617, a SQL Injection vulnerability discovered in WeGIA.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA (Web Manager for Institutions)
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `historico_paciente.php`
*   **Description:** A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database queries.  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, including patient data.
*   **Reported By:** security-advisories@github.com
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-26617

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Based on the information provided - this is a critical vulnerability)
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Complete.  An attacker can potentially access all data within the database.
    *   **Integrity:** Complete. An attacker may be able to modify or delete data.
    *   **Availability:** Complete. An attacker may be able to cause a denial of service by manipulating the database.

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   **Exploit Status:**  Exploitable.  While specific exploit details are not provided in this document, the nature of SQL injection vulnerabilities means that exploitation is highly likely.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote. The `historico_paciente.php` endpoint is likely accessible over the network, making it a remote attack vector.
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low.  SQL injection vulnerabilities are often relatively simple to exploit with readily available tools.
*   **Authentication:** None likely required. SQL injection often bypasses authentication mechanisms.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

*   **Immediate Action:**  **Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.14 immediately.**  This is the recommended and primary solution to address the vulnerability.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (if immediate upgrade is not possible):**

*   **Important Note:**  These mitigation steps should be considered temporary measures.  *Upgrading to version 3.2.14 is the only definitive solution.*

    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided input used in SQL queries, specifically focusing on the parameters passed to `historico_paciente.php`.  This includes:
        *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow specific characters or formats that are expected for each input field.
        *   **Blacklisting (less effective):**  Filter out known SQL injection keywords and syntax (e.g., `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `UNION`, `--`, `;`).  *Note: Blacklisting is not a reliable defense against SQL injection.*
        *   **Escaping:** Use proper escaping mechanisms provided by your database library (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string` in PHP) to escape special characters in user input before including it in SQL queries.

    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Switch to using parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) whenever possible.  Parameterized queries separate the SQL query structure from the user-provided data, preventing the data from being interpreted as part of the SQL code.  Most database libraries offer support for prepared statements.

    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules configured to detect and block SQL injection attempts.  WAFs can provide an additional layer of defense by analyzing incoming HTTP requests and blocking malicious traffic.  Ensure the WAF is properly configured and regularly updated.

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by WeGIA has only the minimum necessary privileges required to perform its functions.  This can limit the potential damage if the SQL injection vulnerability is exploited. For example, do not grant the database user 'root' or 'administrator' access.

    *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, segment the WeGIA server from other critical systems on the network. This can help to contain the potential impact of a successful attack.

    *   **Monitor Logs:**  Enable and monitor application and database logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual SQL queries or error messages related to database access.

**6. Verification:**

*   After upgrading or implementing mitigation measures, thoroughly test the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint to verify that the SQL injection vulnerability has been addressed.  Use penetration testing techniques and tools to simulate potential attacks.  Consider engaging a security professional for a comprehensive assessment.

**7. Communication:**

*   Inform users of WeGIA about the vulnerability and the importance of upgrading to the latest version.
*   Clearly communicate the risks associated with not addressing the vulnerability.

**8. Long-Term Security Practices:**

*   Implement secure coding practices and security training for developers to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
*   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the WeGIA application.
*   Keep all software and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
*   Establish a vulnerability management process to promptly address and remediate security vulnerabilities.

**Disclaimer:**

This remediation and mitigation strategy is based on the limited information provided in the vulnerability report. A more comprehensive assessment may be necessary to fully address the risks associated with this vulnerability. It is crucial to consult with security professionals and follow best practices for securing web applications.
