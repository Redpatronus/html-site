### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `historico_paciente.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The application's `historico_paciente.php` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the input parameters (likely through GET or POST requests) to inject malicious SQL code. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, directly query, modify, or delete data within the database, and potentially gain complete control of the affected application and underlying system. The root cause lies in the insufficient input validation and sanitization performed by the application on user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries. Unvalidated input is directly concatenated into SQL queries, allowing for arbitrary SQL code execution.

### Remediation
The primary remediation is to upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later, where the SQL injection vulnerability in `historico_paciente.php` has been patched.

1.  **Upgrade WeGIA:** The most effective solution is to upgrade to the latest version (3.2.14 or later) of WeGIA. Follow the official upgrade instructions provided by the WeGIA project.

2.  **Verify the Patch:** After upgrading, verify that the vulnerability has been successfully patched.  You can attempt to exploit the vulnerability manually (in a controlled environment) to ensure the fix is effective. Alternatively, consult the release notes or changelog for the upgrade to confirm that the SQL injection issue has been addressed.

3.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the WeGIA application to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities proactively.

4.  **Secure Coding Practices:** Ensure that developers follow secure coding practices, including proper input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries (or prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a web application firewall (WAF) in front of the WeGIA application.  Configure the WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attacks. While a WAF can provide an additional layer of security, it should not be considered a replacement for patching the underlying vulnerability.
