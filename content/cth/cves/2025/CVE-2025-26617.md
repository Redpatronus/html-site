## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26617 - WeGIA SQL Injection

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategies for a SQL Injection vulnerability identified in the WeGIA application.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability ID:** CVE-2025-26617
*   **Component:** WeGIA (Web Manager for Institutions)
*   **Location:** `historico_paciente.php` endpoint
*   **Description:** A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database via a vulnerable parameter. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, including patient data.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Based on data provided, assumed to be v3 base score)
*   **Severity Level:** **Critical**

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   Yes, the vulnerability is exploitable.  An attacker can inject SQL queries into the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint to access and potentially modify sensitive data.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

*   **Primary Action:**  **Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.14 or later immediately.** This version contains the fix for the SQL Injection vulnerability.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Backup:** Before upgrading, create a complete backup of your WeGIA installation, including the application files and the database. This is crucial for rollback in case of any unforeseen issues.
    2.  **Download:** Download the latest version (3.2.14 or later) from the official WeGIA source or repository.
    3.  **Upgrade:** Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions.  This usually involves replacing the existing application files with the new version and potentially running database migration scripts.
    4.  **Verification:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint and other application functionalities to ensure the upgrade was successful and the vulnerability is no longer present. Try injecting various SQL injection payloads to confirm the fix.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (If immediate upgrade is not possible):**

*   **Important:** These mitigations are **temporary** and should be implemented only as a short-term solution while planning and executing the upgrade to version 3.2.14 or later.

    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on the `historico_paciente.php` endpoint. Sanitize and validate all user-supplied input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
        *   **Method:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.  Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not as executable code.
        *   **Regular Expressions (Less Recommended):** As a last resort, use regular expressions to filter out potentially malicious SQL keywords and characters (e.g., `SELECT`, `UNION`, `;`, `--`, etc.). However, this is not a foolproof solution and can be bypassed.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF (Web Application Firewall) in front of the WeGIA application.  Configure the WAF with rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
    *   **Database Permissions:** Review and restrict database user privileges.  Ensure that the WeGIA application only has the minimum necessary permissions to access and modify the database.  Avoid using a database user with administrative privileges.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the WeGIA application and database server on a separate network segment.  Restrict network access to only authorized users and systems.
    *   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activity.  Monitor application logs for SQL injection attempts.

**6. Testing and Verification:**

*   After implementing the remediation or mitigation strategies, thoroughly test the WeGIA application to ensure that the vulnerability has been addressed and that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced.

**7. Communication:**

*   Inform all affected users about the vulnerability and the necessary steps to mitigate the risk.

**8. Long-Term Security Measures:**

*   Implement a regular security patching and upgrade schedule for all software components.
*   Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential security issues.
*   Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent future vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a security awareness program to educate users about common security threats and best practices.
