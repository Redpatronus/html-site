### Summary
A time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior EditEventAttendees.php within the EN_tyid parameter. The parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL commands. Please note that the vulnerability requires Administrator permissions. This flaw can potentially allow attackers to delay the response, indicating the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. While it is a time-based blind injection, it can be exploited to gain insights into the underlying database, and with further exploitation, sensitive data could be retrieved.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability resides in the `EditEventAttendees.php` file of ChurchCRM versions 5.13.0 and earlier. The `EN_tyid` parameter, used within this script, is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection. An attacker with Administrator privileges can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter, potentially manipulating the database. Because it's a blind SQL injection, the attacker can't directly see the results of their query but can infer information based on the time it takes for the server to respond, allowing them to potentially extract data.

### Remediation
To mitigate the risk of CVE-2025-1132, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** The most effective solution is to upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a fix for this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website or release notes for updates.
2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement proper input sanitization for the `EN_tyid` parameter in the `EditEventAttendees.php` file. This involves validating and cleaning the input data to remove or escape any potentially malicious characters or SQL commands.
3.  **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user-supplied input into SQL queries. Parameterized queries ensure that user input is treated as data, not as executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks.
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Review and restrict user privileges. Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This can limit the impact of a successful SQL injection attack, as an attacker with limited privileges will have less access to sensitive data.
5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts. A WAF can provide an additional layer of security by filtering out malicious traffic before it reaches the ChurchCRM application.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the ChurchCRM application and its infrastructure.
7.  **Database Auditing:** Enable database auditing to track and log all database activities, including SQL queries. This can help detect and investigate suspicious activity that may indicate a SQL injection attack.
8.  **Temporary mitigation:** Disable the usage of EditEventAttendees.php, or require additional authorization before usage.
