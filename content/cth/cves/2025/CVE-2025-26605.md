- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
CVE-2025-26605 details a SQL Injection vulnerability affecting the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint in WeGIA, an open-source web manager popular with Portuguese-speaking institutions. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could compromise sensitive information stored in the database. The vulnerability exists because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query within the `deletar_cargo.php` file. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to be authenticated.  Version 3.2.13 addresses this vulnerability.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy for CVE-2025-26605 is to **upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 or later**. This version contains the fix for the SQL Injection vulnerability in `deletar_cargo.php`.

**Steps for Remediation:**

1.  **Backup:** Before upgrading, create a full backup of the WeGIA application and its database. This will allow you to restore the system to its previous state if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
2.  **Upgrade:** Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions to upgrade to version 3.2.13 or later. Consult the WeGIA documentation for the correct procedure.
3.  **Verification:** After upgrading, verify that the vulnerability has been resolved. This can be done by attempting to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability again in a controlled environment. If the exploit fails, the upgrade was successful.
4.  **Monitor:** Monitor the WeGIA application for any suspicious activity after the upgrade. Implement security monitoring and logging to detect and respond to any potential security incidents.

**Alternative Mitigations (If immediate upgrade is not possible):**

While upgrading is the recommended solution, consider these temporary mitigations if an immediate upgrade isn't feasible:

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF with rules to detect and block SQL Injection attacks. Configure the WAF to inspect traffic to `deletar_cargo.php` for malicious SQL patterns. *Note: This is not a full protection and can be bypassed.*

These alternative mitigations are **not substitutes for upgrading** to a patched version of WeGIA and should only be used as temporary measures.
