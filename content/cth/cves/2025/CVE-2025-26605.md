## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26605 - WeGIA SQL Injection Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-26605, a SQL Injection vulnerability found in WeGIA, an open-source Web Manager for Institutions.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA (Web Manager for Institutions)
*   **Affected Component:** `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint
*   **Description:** The `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint in WeGIA version prior to 3.2.13 is vulnerable to SQL injection. An authorized attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries through this endpoint. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification, and potentially complete control of the database server.
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-26605

**2. Severity Assessment:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:** The provided data doesn't include a CVSS vector string. Assuming a standard SQL injection scenario with high impact, a possible vector could be:  `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Justification:** The ability to inject arbitrary SQL queries allows for a high degree of impact, including data theft, modification, and denial of service. The fact that only an *authorized* attacker is required mitigates the score somewhat compared to a completely unauthenticated exploit, but it remains a critical vulnerability.

**3. Known Exploit Information:**

*   **Exploit Status:** Exploit exists.  The vulnerability has been discovered and publicly disclosed.
*   **Exploit Details:** An authorized user can craft malicious requests to the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint that contain SQL injection payloads within the request parameters.  This can allow the attacker to bypass authentication checks or directly manipulate database records.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database (user credentials, personal information, financial data, etc.)
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially execute commands on the database server, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   Bypass authentication and authorization controls.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

*   **Primary Recommendation: Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 or later.**  This version contains a patch that addresses the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Action:** Download the latest version of WeGIA from the official source (e.g., GitHub repository or official website).
    *   **Procedure:** Follow the upgrade instructions provided by the WeGIA developers.  Typically, this involves replacing the existing files with the new version files.
    *   **Testing:**  After the upgrade, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionality is working as expected and that the SQL injection vulnerability has been resolved. Focus on testing the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint with various inputs, including potentially malicious payloads, to verify the patch.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible):**

*   **There are no known workarounds provided.**  Due to the nature of SQL injection, implementing reliable workarounds without patching the underlying code is difficult and potentially unreliable.  However, consider the following *temporary* measures, realizing they provide limited protection and are *not* a substitute for upgrading:

    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:**  Implement WAF rules that attempt to detect and block SQL injection attempts against the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint.  This requires careful configuration and ongoing monitoring to avoid false positives and ensure effectiveness. Example rules might include:
        *   Blocking requests containing SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `UNION`) in input parameters for `deletar_cargo.php`.
        *   Limiting the length of input parameters.
        *   Blocking requests with unusual characters or patterns often used in SQL injection attacks.

    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (NOT a replacement for proper coding):**  While this should have been done originally, implement *additional* input validation and sanitization on the server-side for all parameters used by the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint. This includes:
        *   Validating data types (e.g., ensuring numeric fields contain only numbers).
        *   Sanitizing input by escaping special characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands.
        *   Using parameterized queries or prepared statements (though this requires code changes and likely means you are now modifying the original code, which would make upgrading easier).
        *  **Important:** Ensure that the sanitization methods match the specific database being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

    *   **Restrict Access (Least Privilege):**  Review and restrict access to the `deletar_cargo.php` functionality to only those users who absolutely require it.  Implement strong authentication and authorization controls to prevent unauthorized access to the application.

    *   **Database Monitoring:** Implement database activity monitoring to detect suspicious SQL queries that might indicate an attempted SQL injection attack.  Configure alerts to notify security personnel of any unusual activity.

**6. Monitoring and Verification:**

*   **Post-Upgrade Testing:** After applying the upgrade, conduct thorough testing of the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint with various inputs, including potentially malicious payloads, to verify that the SQL injection vulnerability has been fully resolved.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests of the WeGIA application to identify and address any new vulnerabilities that might emerge.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning into your software development lifecycle to proactively identify security flaws before they are deployed to production.

**7. Communication:**

*   **Notify Users:**  Inform all users of the WeGIA application about the SQL injection vulnerability and the importance of upgrading to the latest version.
*   **Internal Reporting:**  Report the vulnerability and the remediation plan to the relevant stakeholders within your organization (e.g., security team, IT department, management).

**Important Notes:**

*   The mitigation strategies listed above are temporary measures and should not be considered a substitute for upgrading to the latest version of WeGIA.
*   Implementing these mitigation strategies requires technical expertise and careful configuration to avoid disrupting application functionality.
*   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any new information or exploits related to WeGIA.

By following this remediation and mitigation strategy, organizations can effectively reduce the risk posed by CVE-2025-26605 and protect their sensitive data.
