## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26605 - WeGIA SQL Injection Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-26605, a SQL Injection vulnerability found in the WeGIA application.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Application:** WeGIA Web Manager for Institutions
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `deletar_cargo.php`
*   **Description:**  A SQL Injection vulnerability exists within the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database queries. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification, or even complete database compromise.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)
*   **Severity Level:** Critical
*   **Justification:**  A CVSS score of 9.4 indicates a critical vulnerability due to the high potential impact and relative ease of exploitation. SQL Injection vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise, making this a high-priority issue.  Authenticated access is required, reducing the severity slightly from an unauthenticated injection, but it is still considered critical.

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   **Exploitability:**  Exploitable.  The vulnerability is present in the `deletar_cargo.php` endpoint and can be triggered by manipulating input parameters used in SQL queries. The ease of crafting SQL injection attacks makes this a high concern.
*   **Exploit Details (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker could inject SQL code into a parameter passed to `deletar_cargo.php` related to the cargo ID (position ID).
    *   **Example Payload:**  `deletar_cargo.php?id_cargo=1; DROP TABLE users;--`
    *   **Impact:**  This payload could potentially drop the `users` table, leading to a denial of service and potential loss of user data.  More sophisticated payloads can be used to extract data.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

*   **Primary Remediation:** **Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 or later.**  This version contains the fix for the SQL Injection vulnerability. This is the *most important* and *highest priority* action.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible):**

If an immediate upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.13 is not possible, implement the following mitigation strategies as a temporary workaround:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Implement:**  Rigorous input validation and sanitization on all parameters passed to `deletar_cargo.php` and any other endpoints that interact with the database.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Whitelist:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and input formats.
        *   **Sanitize:**  Remove or encode potentially malicious characters (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons, hyphens) using appropriate encoding functions for the database in use (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string` in PHP).
        *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that input values match the expected data type (e.g., integer, string).  Cast variables into the expected types.
*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**
    *   **Implement:**  Convert all SQL queries in `deletar_cargo.php` and other relevant endpoints to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
    *   **Benefits:**  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data, preventing the database from interpreting user-supplied input as code.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Implement:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the WeGIA application has only the minimum necessary privileges to perform its required tasks.  Avoid using a privileged user account (e.g., `root`) for application database access.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Implement:**  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the WeGIA application.
    *   **Configuration:**  Configure the WAF with rules to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns.  Regularly update WAF rules to address emerging threats.  Consider using a WAF that includes virtual patching capabilities, allowing temporary fixes without application code changes.
*   **Database Monitoring and Auditing:**
    *   **Implement:**  Enable database logging and auditing to track database activity, including SQL queries executed by the WeGIA application.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual SQL queries, excessive error messages, or attempts to access sensitive data.  Set up alerts for potential SQL injection attacks.

**6. Monitoring and Verification:**

*   **Regular Scanning:** After implementing the remediation and/or mitigation strategies, conduct regular vulnerability scans of the WeGIA application to ensure that the SQL Injection vulnerability has been effectively addressed.  Use a reputable vulnerability scanner with up-to-date vulnerability definitions.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Consider engaging a qualified security professional to conduct penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.
*   **Log Analysis:** Continuously monitor application and database logs for any signs of suspicious activity.

**7. Communication:**

*   **Inform Users:** Notify all WeGIA users about the vulnerability and the need to upgrade to version 3.2.13 or later.  Provide clear instructions on how to perform the upgrade.
*   **Internal Communication:**  Keep internal IT staff informed about the vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation plan.

**8. Timeline:**

*   **Upgrade to WeGIA 3.2.13:** As soon as possible.  *This is the highest priority.*
*   **Implement Mitigation Strategies (if upgrade delayed):** Within 1 week of vulnerability identification.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Within 2 weeks of implementing remediation/mitigation.
*   **Ongoing Monitoring and Log Analysis:** Continuously.

**9. Roles and Responsibilities:**

*   **System Administrators:** Responsible for upgrading the WeGIA application and implementing the mitigation strategies.
*   **Security Team:** Responsible for vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and monitoring of application and database logs.
*   **Development Team (if involved):** Responsible for reviewing code and implementing necessary security changes.

**Disclaimer:** This remediation/mitigation strategy is based on the provided information and is intended as a general guideline. The specific steps required to address the vulnerability may vary depending on the WeGIA application's configuration and environment.  Always consult with security professionals and follow best practices for securing web applications and databases. This is a *sample* and should be tailored to the specific environment.
