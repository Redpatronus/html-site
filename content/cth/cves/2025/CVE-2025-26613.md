### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. An OS Command Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `gerenciar_backup.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability exists in the `gerenciar_backup.php` file of WeGIA.  Due to insufficient input sanitization and validation of user-supplied data, an attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands. This occurs when processing requests to this endpoint. Successful exploitation allows for complete system compromise, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or denial-of-service.  The CVSS v3 score reflects the high potential impact of this vulnerability.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later**. This version contains the fix for the OS Command Injection vulnerability.  

**Steps to Remediation:**

1.  **Backup:** Before applying the update, create a full backup of the WeGIA application, including the database and all associated files. This will allow you to restore the system to its previous state if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
2.  **Upgrade:** Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions to upgrade to version 3.2.14 or later. This usually involves replacing the existing application files with the new version's files and potentially running database migration scripts.
3.  **Verification:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the WeGIA application to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected, especially the `gerenciar_backup.php` endpoint.
4.  **Monitoring:** Implement security monitoring tools to detect any suspicious activity that could indicate a potential exploitation attempt.
5.  **Security Audit**: Perform a security audit of the WeGIA instance to ensure that the vulnerability is fully patched and to identify any other potential security weaknesses.

Since no workaround exist, upgrading is the only way to protect your system.
