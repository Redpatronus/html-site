## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-27092 in GHOSTS

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-27092, a path traversal vulnerability found in GHOSTS (Open Source User Simulation Framework).

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in GHOSTS Photo Retrieval Endpoint
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-27092
*   **Affected Software:** GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0
*   **Description:** A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint.  The application fails to properly sanitize file paths provided via the `photoLink` value when creating NPCs.  This allows attackers to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`) to access files outside the intended photo directory.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read on the server.  An attacker can read sensitive system files (configuration files, credentials, etc.) with the permissions of the web application process.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:** (Based on provided data, we can infer parts of the CVSS vector)
    *   Likely includes:  AV:N (Network), AC:L (Low), PR:L (Low - assumes some level of access to create/modify NPCs), UI:N (None), S:C (Changed - impacts other components), C:H (High), I:N (None), A:N (None)
*   **Justification:**  The ability to read arbitrary files on the server with potentially sensitive data constitutes a high-severity vulnerability.  The ease of exploitation (low attack complexity) further increases the severity.

**3. Known Exploits:**

*   The provided advisory doesn't specifically detail exploits but describes the mechanism:
    *   Create an NPC with a `photoLink` value containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`).
    *   Access the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint for that NPC.
    *   The application will attempt to retrieve the file specified by the manipulated `photoLink`, allowing the attacker to read the contents of the file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` in the example).

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The **primary remediation strategy is to upgrade GHOSTS to version 8.2.7.90 or later.**  This version contains the fix for CVE-2025-27092.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Affected Systems:**  Determine all systems running GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0.
2.  **Backup:** Before upgrading, create a complete backup of the GHOSTS installation, including the application files, database, and configuration files.  This is crucial for rollback if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
3.  **Upgrade GHOSTS:**  Follow the official GHOSTS upgrade instructions to upgrade to version 8.2.7.90 or later.  This usually involves:
    *   Downloading the latest version of GHOSTS.
    *   Stopping the GHOSTS application.
    *   Replacing the existing application files with the new version.
    *   Running any necessary database migrations or upgrade scripts.
    *   Restarting the GHOSTS application.
4.  **Verification:** After the upgrade, verify that the vulnerability is resolved by:
    *   Attempting to create an NPC with a `photoLink` containing path traversal sequences.
    *   Accessing the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint for that NPC.
    *   Confirming that the application does *not* allow access to files outside the intended photo directory.  An error or a default image should be displayed.
5.  **Monitor Logs:**  Monitor application logs for any suspicious activity or attempted path traversal attacks.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Immediate Upgrade is Not Possible):**

If an immediate upgrade is not possible, consider the following temporary mitigations.  **These are not substitutes for upgrading, and should only be used as a temporary measure until the upgrade can be performed.** The advisory states there are "no known workarounds," so these are best practice recommendations and may not be entirely effective.

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Difficult to Implement Without Code Changes):**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the `photoLink` field.
    *   **Important:** This requires code changes and may not be feasible without access to the GHOSTS source code.
    *   Specifically:
        *   Reject any `photoLink` values containing `../`, `..\`, or any other path traversal sequences.
        *   Validate that the `photoLink` value points to a file within the designated photo directory.
        *   Canonicalize the path (e.g., using `realpath` in PHP or equivalent in other languages) to remove any path traversal sequences before accessing the file.

2.  **Restricting Access to the Web Application Process:**
    *   Run the web application process with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running the web application process as root or with other elevated privileges.
    *   Use a dedicated user account with limited permissions.
    *   Implement file system permissions to restrict the web application process's access to only the necessary files and directories.  This can help limit the impact of a successful path traversal attack.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:**
    *   Implement WAF rules to detect and block requests containing path traversal sequences in the `photoLink` parameter.
    *   Configure the WAF to inspect the request parameters and block any requests containing `../`, `..\`, or other suspicious patterns.
    *   Ensure that the WAF is properly configured and updated with the latest rule sets.  Consider using a managed WAF service for easier maintenance.

4.  **Monitor and Alert:**
    *   Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious activity or attempted exploitation.
    *   Monitor web server logs for any requests containing path traversal sequences.
    *   Configure alerts to notify security personnel of any suspicious activity.
    *   Regularly review security logs for any signs of compromise.

**6. Rollback Plan:**

If the upgrade process fails or causes issues, revert to the backup created before the upgrade. This includes restoring the application files, database, and configuration files.

**7. Communication:**

Communicate the vulnerability and remediation plan to all relevant stakeholders, including system administrators, developers, and security personnel. Provide clear instructions and timelines for the upgrade process.

**8. Post-Remediation Activities:**

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  After the upgrade, perform a vulnerability scan to verify that the vulnerability is resolved and to identify any other potential security issues.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Consider conducting penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of the remediation and to identify any other weaknesses in the system.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Provide security awareness training to developers and system administrators on path traversal vulnerabilities and other common web application security risks.

**Disclaimer:** This remediation strategy is based on the information provided in the security advisory.  The specific steps and recommendations may need to be adjusted based on the specific environment and configuration of the GHOSTS installation. Always consult the official GHOSTS documentation for the most up-to-date information and best practices.  Implement this plan at your own risk.
