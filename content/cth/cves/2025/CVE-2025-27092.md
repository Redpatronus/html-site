## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-27092 - GHOSTS Path Traversal Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-27092, a path traversal vulnerability discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0.

### 1. Vulnerability Description

*   **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal
*   **Affected Software:** GHOSTS (Open Source User Simulation Framework)
*   **Affected Version:** 8.0.0.0
*   **Location:** `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint
*   **Description:**  The `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint, responsible for serving profile photos for NPCs, is vulnerable to path traversal. When an NPC is created with a crafted `photoLink` value containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`), the application incorrectly processes these sequences, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended photo directory.  This allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process.
*   **Fixed Version:** 8.2.7.90

### 2. Severity

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality Impact: High** - An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Integrity Impact: None** - An attacker cannot modify files on the server.
    *   **Availability Impact: None** - An attacker cannot disrupt the service.
*   **Explanation:** The high severity is due to the potential for an attacker to read sensitive files, such as configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data, giving them potentially significant control over the system or network.

### 3. Known Exploits

*   **Exploit Method:**  An attacker can create an NPC with a malicious `photoLink` value. When the application attempts to retrieve the photo using the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint, the path traversal sequences in the `photoLink` allow the attacker to navigate to arbitrary directories and retrieve the contents of files.  For example: `/api/npcs/123/photo?photoLink=../../../../etc/passwd`.

### 4. Remediation Strategy

The primary and recommended remediation is to upgrade to the patched version of GHOSTS.

*   **Immediate Action:**
    *   **Upgrade:**  Upgrade GHOSTS to version **8.2.7.90** or later.  This version contains the fix for the path traversal vulnerability.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy (If immediate upgrade is not possible)

If an immediate upgrade is not feasible, consider the following mitigation strategies, although these are NOT substitutes for upgrading.  **There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability, so mitigation is difficult without an upgrade. These are highly suggested to be implemented alongside an upgrade for layered security**

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Implement strict whitelisting on the `photoLink` field.  Only allow specific file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`) and filenames.  Reject any input that contains directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\`, etc.). This is complex and may break existing functionality.
    *   **Path Sanitization:**  Implement robust path sanitization.  Use secure coding practices to normalize and canonicalize file paths, removing any directory traversal sequences before attempting to access the file.  Ensure that the application always resolves the path relative to the intended photo directory.  Again, this is complex and prone to errors if not implemented carefully.

*   **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Restrict Web Application Permissions:** Ensure that the web application process runs with the minimum necessary privileges. Limit the permissions of the user account under which the web server is running. This limits the impact of a successful exploit by restricting the files the attacker can access.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Deploy WAF Rules:**  Deploy WAF rules to detect and block requests containing path traversal sequences in the `photoLink` parameter.  Configure the WAF to log and alert on suspicious activity.  Be careful of false positives.

*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Enable Detailed Logging:** Enable detailed logging for all requests to the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint.  Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as requests with path traversal sequences or attempts to access sensitive files.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Implement an IDS to detect and alert on suspicious activity related to the vulnerability.

### 6. Verification

*   **Post-Upgrade Testing:** After upgrading or implementing mitigation measures, thoroughly test the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint to ensure that the path traversal vulnerability has been addressed.  Attempt to create NPCs with malicious `photoLink` values and verify that the application correctly rejects these requests and does not allow access to unauthorized files.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address any new vulnerabilities.

### 7. Communication

*   **Inform Users:** Inform users of GHOSTS about the vulnerability and the importance of upgrading.
*   **Internal Communication:** Keep all relevant internal teams (developers, security, operations) informed about the vulnerability and the remediation/mitigation strategy.

**Disclaimer:**  This remediation/mitigation strategy is based on the information provided in the security advisory.  It is essential to thoroughly evaluate the vulnerability in your specific environment and tailor the remediation and mitigation measures accordingly.
