## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-27092 - GHOSTS Path Traversal Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-27092, a path traversal vulnerability discovered in the GHOSTS user simulation framework.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

* **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal
* **Affected Software:** GHOSTS (Open Source User Simulation Framework)
* **Affected Version:** 8.0.0.0
* **Endpoint:** `/api/npcs/{id}/photo`
* **Root Cause:** The `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint, intended to serve profile photos for Non-Player Characters (NPCs), fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths provided in the `photoLink` value during NPC creation.  An attacker can insert path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`) into the `photoLink`, allowing them to access files outside the intended photo directory.

**2. Severity:**

* **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality:** High - An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process. This could expose sensitive data like configuration files, credentials, or other secrets.
    * **Integrity:** None (Directly) - The vulnerability primarily allows for reading files, not modifying them.  However, leaked credentials could lead to integrity compromises.
    * **Availability:** None (Directly) - The vulnerability doesn't directly affect the availability of the system. However, accessing and potentially deleting crucial files could indirectly impact availability.

**3. Known Exploit:**

* An attacker crafts a malicious `photoLink` value during NPC creation that contains path traversal sequences.
* When a request is made to `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` for an NPC with the malicious `photoLink`, the application processes the path traversal sequence, leading to the retrieval of unintended files.
* Example:  `photoLink` set to `../../../etc/passwd` could potentially allow an attacker to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the server.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

* **Immediate Action: Upgrade to Version 8.2.7.90 or Later:**  This is the *only* recommended solution.  The vulnerability has been patched in version 8.2.7.90, so upgrading is the most effective way to address the issue.
* **Verification:** After upgrading, verify that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed by attempting to exploit the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint with path traversal sequences. Ensure the application properly handles or rejects these requests.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (If Upgrade is Not Immediately Possible - *Not Recommended*):**

* **There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Upgrading is strongly recommended as the sole reliable solution.**  The following are *highly discouraged* as they are likely incomplete and provide a false sense of security.  They are included only for completeness in an emergency situation where an immediate upgrade is impossible, and should be considered *temporary* measures only.

    * **Input Validation and Sanitization (Difficult and Risky):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the `photoLink` value.  Specifically:
        * **Whitelist Approach:** Define an allowed set of characters or file extensions. Only permit files that match these criteria.  This is the most secure approach but requires careful consideration of legitimate photo file names.
        * **Path Traversal Prevention:**  Reject any input containing sequences like `../`, `..\`, `%2E%2E/`, `%2E%2E\`, or any other encoded or obfuscated path traversal attempts.
        * **Canonicalization:** Convert the input path to its absolute, canonical form and verify it is within the expected directory.
        * **Problem:** It is very difficult to account for all possible variations and encoding methods that an attacker might use.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules (Partial Mitigation):**  Configure a WAF to detect and block requests containing path traversal sequences targeting the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint.
        * **Rule Example:**  A rule that blocks requests containing `../` or `..\` in the request URL or body.
        * **Problem:** WAF rules can be bypassed with obfuscation or encoding, offering limited protection.
    * **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the web application process runs with the least privileges necessary.  This limits the impact if the vulnerability is exploited. Even if an attacker gains access, they will only be able to access files that the web application process has permission to read.
    * **Monitor and Alert:** Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity, such as requests to the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint with unusual file paths or access patterns.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Upgrade is Paramount:** The mitigation strategies listed above are *not a substitute* for upgrading to the patched version of GHOSTS.  They should only be considered as temporary measures while planning and executing the upgrade.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test any mitigation strategies to ensure they are effective and do not introduce unintended side effects.
* **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continue to monitor for suspicious activity even after upgrading, as new vulnerabilities may be discovered in the future.

This remediation and mitigation strategy aims to provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the CVE-2025-27092 vulnerability in the GHOSTS framework.  Prioritizing the upgrade to the patched version is critical to ensure the long-term security of the system.
