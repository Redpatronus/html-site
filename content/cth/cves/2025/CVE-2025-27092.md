## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-27092 - GHOSTS Path Traversal Vulnerability

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal
*   **Affected Software:** GHOSTS (user simulation framework)
*   **Affected Version:** 8.0.0.0
*   **Location:** `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint
*   **Description:** A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint.  The application fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths provided in the `photoLink` value when creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs).  By crafting a `photoLink` value containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`), an attacker can access files outside of the intended photo directory.  This allows reading arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.

**Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)
*   **Severity Level:** High
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** High -  An attacker can read sensitive files, including configuration files, credentials, and other potentially sensitive data stored on the server.
    *   **Integrity:** None - The vulnerability primarily allows read access, not modification.
    *   **Availability:** None - The vulnerability primarily allows read access, not denial of service.

**Known Exploit:**

*   An attacker can create an NPC with a maliciously crafted `photoLink` value that includes path traversal sequences.  When the application attempts to serve the photo using the `/api/npcs/{id}/photo` endpoint, the path traversal sequences are processed without proper sanitization, allowing access to arbitrary files.
*   **Example:**  If the intended photo directory is `/opt/ghosts/npc_photos`, an attacker could set `photoLink` to `../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the system's password file.  Access is granted using the permissions of the application process.

**Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Immediate Action: Upgrade GHOSTS:** The vulnerability is fixed in version **8.2.7.90**.  The highest priority is to upgrade to this version or a later patched version immediately.

2.  **Verification:** After upgrading, verify that the vulnerability is no longer present.  Attempt to exploit the vulnerability using a test `photoLink` value containing path traversal sequences.  Ensure that the application properly handles the input and does not allow access to files outside of the intended photo directory.

3.  **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the `photoLink` field. This should include:

    *   **Path Normalization:** Convert the provided path to a standard form (e.g., using a function like `os.path.normpath` in Python) to remove redundant path separators and resolve relative paths.
    *   **Path Validation:**  Verify that the resolved path is within the allowed directory (e.g., `/opt/ghosts/npc_photos`).  Reject any paths that traverse outside of this directory.
    *   **Blacklisting/Whitelisting:**  Consider blacklisting or whitelisting specific characters or sequences known to be associated with path traversal attacks (e.g., `../`, `..\`, `%2e%2e/`).  However, whitelisting is generally a more secure approach, specifying only the allowed characters for file names.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web application process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the impact of a successful exploit.  If the application only needs to read files in the photo directory, grant it only read access to that directory.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application.  This includes reviewing code for input validation issues, authentication and authorization flaws, and other common web application vulnerabilities.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Consider deploying a WAF to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.  Configure the WAF to inspect requests for path traversal sequences and other suspicious patterns.

7.  **File System Permissions:**  Ensure that the application's photo directory and other sensitive directories have appropriate file system permissions.  Prevent unauthorized access to these directories.

8.  **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity.  Monitor for unusual file access patterns, error messages related to file access, and other indicators of potential exploitation.

**Workarounds:**

*   **There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability other than upgrading to the patched version.**  Therefore, upgrading is the *only* recommended course of action.  Do not rely on other mitigation strategies as a primary means of addressing the vulnerability.

**Timeline:**

*   **Immediate:** Apply the upgrade to version 8.2.7.90 or later.
*   **Within 1 week:** Implement input validation and sanitization measures.
*   **Within 1 month:** Conduct a security audit and penetration test of the application.
*   **Ongoing:**  Maintain regular security monitoring and implement the practices described above.
