### Summary
Monero through 0.18.3.4 before ec74ff4 does not have response limits on HTTP server connections.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 8.6
- **Exploitability Score**: 3.9
- **Impact Score**: 4.0
- **Exploitable**: 0


### Details 
CVE-2025-26819 details a vulnerability in Monero versions up to 0.18.3.4 before commit ec74ff4. Specifically, the Monero HTTP server lacks proper response limits.  This means a malicious actor could potentially exhaust server resources by sending specially crafted requests that generate excessively large responses.  The lack of response limits allows attackers to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by overwhelming the server with data.  The CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 reflects the high potential for impact due to the possibility of disrupting Monero node operations and potentially affecting network availability.

### Remediation
The recommended remediation is to upgrade Monero to a version containing the fix for this vulnerability. This involves either building from source after commit ec74ff4 or upgrading to a later official release of Monero that incorporates this patch. For systems running vulnerable versions (<= 0.18.3.4), immediate action should be taken to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Users should download the latest version of Monero from the official website and follow the provided upgrade instructions. If immediate upgrade isn't possible, consider implementing temporary workarounds such as network-level rate limiting to restrict the number of connections or the size of responses allowed to the Monero HTTP server. However, these workarounds provide only partial protection and upgrading is the most effective solution.
