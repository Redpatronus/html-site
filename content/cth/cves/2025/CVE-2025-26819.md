## CVE-2025-26819: Monero HTTP Server Connection DoS Vulnerability

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategy for CVE-2025-26819, a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability affecting Monero versions up to 0.18.3.4 (specifically, before the commit ec74ff4).

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

The Monero HTTP server, in versions up to 0.18.3.4, lacks proper response limits on HTTP server connections. This omission allows a malicious actor to overwhelm the server by sending a high volume of HTTP requests, potentially exhausting server resources and rendering it unresponsive to legitimate users.  The vulnerability stems from the absence of mechanisms to limit the size or duration of responses sent by the HTTP server.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:** (Based on provided data, approximating a likely vector) CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
*   **Explanation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with no user interaction or authentication required. A successful exploit can lead to a significant denial of service, impacting the availability of the Monero node. The provided CVSS Base Score is 8.6 and aligns with a remote DoS vulnerability with no user interaction or authentication.

**3. Known Exploits:**

While specific, publicly available exploit code may not be widely circulated, the nature of the vulnerability makes it relatively straightforward to exploit.  A simple HTTP flooding tool or script, configured to target the Monero node's HTTP port, could be used to initiate a DoS attack. The absence of response limits allows the attacker to continuously send requests and receive responses, consuming the server's resources until it becomes unavailable.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary remediation is to **upgrade to a version of Monero containing the fix provided by commit ec74ff4 or later.** This commit likely introduces response limits and other resource management measures to mitigate the DoS vulnerability.

*   **Action:** Upgrade the Monero software to the latest stable version (greater than 0.18.3.4).
*   **Priority:** Critical. This should be addressed immediately.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Backup:**  Back up the Monero wallet and blockchain data before initiating the upgrade.  This is crucial to prevent data loss in case of unforeseen issues during the upgrade process.
    2.  **Download:** Download the latest official release of Monero from the official Monero website (getmonero.org) or verified trusted source.
    3.  **Verify:** Verify the integrity of the downloaded software by checking its cryptographic hash against the official release information.
    4.  **Install:**  Follow the official Monero upgrade instructions for your operating system.  This typically involves stopping the Monero daemon, replacing the old binaries with the new ones, and restarting the daemon.
    5.  **Monitor:**  After the upgrade, monitor the Monero node for any unusual activity or errors.  Ensure that the node is functioning correctly.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Immediate Upgrade is Not Possible):**

If an immediate upgrade is not feasible, implement the following mitigation measures to reduce the risk of exploitation:

*   **Firewall Rate Limiting:** Configure a firewall to rate-limit incoming HTTP requests to the Monero node's HTTP port (e.g., port 18081 by default).  This limits the number of requests from a single IP address within a specific timeframe, making it more difficult for an attacker to flood the server.

    *   **Example (iptables):**  `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 18081 -m recent --set --name HTTP --rsource`
        `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 18081 -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 100 --name HTTP --rsource -j DROP`
        *   **Explanation:** These rules limit each IP address to 100 connections per minute.  Adjust the `--hitcount` and `--seconds` parameters based on your network's typical traffic patterns.

*   **Reverse Proxy with DoS Protection:**  Place a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache with mod_security) in front of the Monero node. Configure the reverse proxy to provide DoS protection features such as connection limits, request filtering, and rate limiting.

*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Deploy an IDS/IPS that can detect and block malicious HTTP traffic patterns indicative of a DoS attack.  Configure the IDS/IPS to monitor for excessive connection attempts, abnormally large HTTP requests, and other suspicious activities.

*   **Disable HTTP API (If Not Needed):** If the HTTP API is not required for node operation, consider disabling it entirely. This eliminates the attack surface.

*   **Monitor Resource Usage:** Continuously monitor the Monero node's CPU, memory, and network utilization.  Set up alerts to notify administrators when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.  This can help detect and respond to DoS attacks in real-time.

**6. Long-Term Recommendations:**

*   **Regular Patching:** Implement a process for regularly patching and updating the Monero software to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Monero node and its configuration to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Monero node from other critical systems on the network to limit the impact of a successful attack.
*   **DoS Mitigation Service:**  Consider using a cloud-based DoS mitigation service to protect the Monero node from large-scale attacks.
