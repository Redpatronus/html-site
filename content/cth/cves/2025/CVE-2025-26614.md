## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26614 - WeGIA SQL Injection

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA Web Manager for Institutions (versions prior to 3.2.14)
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `deletar_documento.php`
*   **Description:** A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This allows an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification, or even complete compromise of the database.

**2. Severity Assessment:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)
*   **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The vulnerability requires minimal effort to exploit.
    *   **PR:L (Low):**  Requires valid user account, but a low privileged user.
    *   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **S:C (Changed):** An attack through one component can impact other components of the system.
    *   **C:H (High):** There is a high impact to confidentiality (sensitive data can be accessed).
    *   **I:H (High):** There is a high impact to integrity (data can be modified).
    *   **A:H (High):** There is a high impact to availability (the system can be rendered unusable).
*   **Severity:** Critical due to the potential for complete database compromise and sensitive data exposure.  The low attack complexity and no required user interaction makes it easier to exploit.

**3. Known Exploit Information:**

*   **Known Exploits:**  Yes, the vulnerability is publicly known and could be exploited by any authenticated user.
*   **Exploit Potential:**  Relatively high due to the simplicity of SQL injection attacks.

**4. Remediation/Mitigation Strategies:**

The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later immediately.** This version contains a fix for the SQL injection vulnerability in `deletar_documento.php`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Upgrade WeGIA:**
    *   Download the latest version (3.2.14 or later) from the official WeGIA source (if available).
    *   Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions to install the new version. **Important:** Back up your database and application files before performing the upgrade.
    *   Test the upgraded system thoroughly to ensure functionality and the absence of the vulnerability.

2.  **Verification:**
    *   After upgrading, test the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint to verify that the SQL injection vulnerability has been resolved. This can be done using manual testing techniques (e.g., attempting to inject SQL queries into input fields) or automated vulnerability scanners.

3.  **If Upgrade is Immediately Impossible (Temporary Mitigation - NOT RECOMMENDED AS A LONG-TERM SOLUTION):**

    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Difficult and Error-Prone):**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied input to the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint.  Specifically, escape or reject any characters that could be used to construct SQL queries (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons, hyphens, etc.). This is **highly discouraged** as a permanent solution, as it's very difficult to implement correctly and can be easily bypassed.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
        *   Ensure that the database user account used by WeGIA has only the minimum necessary privileges to perform its required tasks.  Restrict access to sensitive tables and data. This will limit the damage that can be done if an attacker successfully exploits the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Limited Protection):**
        *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the WeGIA application.  Configure the WAF to block SQL injection attacks.  WAFs can provide an additional layer of protection, but they are not a substitute for fixing the underlying vulnerability. Ensure the WAF rules are up-to-date.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Backup:**  Always create a backup of your database and application files before making any changes.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test all changes in a non-production environment before deploying them to production.
*   **Monitoring:**  Implement security monitoring to detect and respond to potential attacks.
*   **Vendor Support:** Stay informed about any security updates or advisories from the WeGIA developers.
*   **Communicate:** Inform users of a potential vulnerability and urge them to take security precautions such as using strong, unique passwords.

**Disclaimer:** The temporary mitigation strategies are provided as a short-term solution in cases where immediate upgrades are not possible. They are not substitutes for upgrading the software to the latest secure version.  Implementing these mitigations requires a deep understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.  Incorrect implementation can lead to further security issues. Always prioritize upgrading to the latest secure version as the best solution.
