### Summary
WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `deletar_documento.php` endpoint. This vulnerability allow an authorized attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.4
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The `deletar_documento.php` endpoint in WeGIA versions prior to 3.2.14 is vulnerable to SQL injection. An authenticated attacker can manipulate the input parameters of this endpoint to inject malicious SQL code.  This allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its underlying data. The vulnerability resides in the unsanitized handling of user-supplied input within the SQL query construction. The lack of proper input validation and sanitization allows for the injection of malicious SQL commands.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to **upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.14 or later**. This version contains a fix for the SQL injection vulnerability in the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint.  

Here's a breakdown of the recommended steps:

1.  **Backup:** Before upgrading, create a full backup of your WeGIA database and application files. This ensures you can restore to a known good state if any issues arise during the upgrade process.
2.  **Upgrade:** Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions for your specific deployment environment. This usually involves replacing the existing application files with the new version and running any necessary database migration scripts.
3.  **Verification:** After upgrading, verify that the vulnerability is resolved. This can be done by manually testing the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint with potentially malicious SQL injection payloads to confirm that they are properly sanitized or rejected.
4.  **Monitor:** Continuously monitor your WeGIA installation for any suspicious activity or signs of compromise, even after upgrading. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools to help with this process.
5.  **Security Best Practices:** Review your overall WeGIA security configuration and ensure that you are following security best practices, such as using strong passwords, limiting user privileges, and keeping your software up to date.
