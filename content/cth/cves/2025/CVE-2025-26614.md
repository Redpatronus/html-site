## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26614: SQL Injection in WeGIA

This document outlines the strategy for addressing the SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-26614) found in the WeGIA application.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** WeGIA (Web Manager for Institutions)
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `deletar_documento.php`
*   **Description:** The WeGIA application contains a SQL injection vulnerability within the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint.  An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.  This allows the attacker to potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive information, including user credentials, institutional data, and other critical assets stored within the database.  The vulnerability exists because user-supplied input to `deletar_documento.php` is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in a SQL query.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Network, Low Attack Complexity, Low Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, High Availability Impact)
*   **Severity Level:** Critical

**Justification for Severity:**  The high CVSS score reflects the significant impact of this vulnerability.  An attacker with low-level access can completely compromise the application's data, leading to severe data breaches, service disruption, and potential reputational damage.  The vulnerability requires no user interaction, making it easily exploitable.

**3. Known Exploit:**

*   **Exploit Status:** Exploitable, potentially publicly available exploits exist (given CVSS and severity).
*   **Details:**  The specifics of the exploit would involve crafting a malicious HTTP request to `deletar_documento.php` containing SQL injection payloads within the parameters expected by the endpoint.  A common example might involve injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter of the `deletar_documento.php` URL.  For instance:

        http://wegia.example.com/deletar_documento.php?id=1'; DROP TABLE users;--
    
    This example attempts to drop the `users` table, showcasing the potential impact. Actual exploits would depend on the database structure and implemented filtering (if any).

**4. Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

*   **Priority:** Immediate.  This vulnerability poses a critical risk and requires immediate action.

*   **Recommended Solution:** **Upgrade to WeGIA version 3.2.14 or later.**  The vendor has patched this vulnerability in version 3.2.14.  This is the most effective and recommended solution.

*   **Implementation Steps:**

    1.  **Backup Database:**  Before performing any upgrade, create a complete backup of the WeGIA database and application files. This is essential for recovery in case of unforeseen issues during the upgrade process.
    2.  **Download Latest Version:** Download WeGIA version 3.2.14 or a later stable version from the official WeGIA website or trusted repository.
    3.  **Upgrade Application:** Follow the vendor's documented upgrade procedure. This typically involves replacing the existing application files with the new version and potentially running database migration scripts.  Refer to the WeGIA documentation for detailed upgrade instructions.
    4.  **Verify Upgrade:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionality is working as expected and that the vulnerability has been successfully patched.  Specifically, test the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint and other areas where user input is processed.
    5.  **Monitor Logs:**  Continuously monitor application and database logs for any suspicious activity, including potential SQL injection attempts.

*   **Short-Term Mitigation (If immediate upgrade is not possible - NOT RECOMMENDED, HIGH RISK):**

    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Difficult and Error-Prone):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the `deletar_documento.php` endpoint and any other endpoints that process user input.  This involves:
        *   **Whitelisting:** Define acceptable characters and formats for each input field.
        *   **Escaping:** Properly escape all special characters that could be interpreted as SQL code (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons).
        *   **Parameterization (Prepared Statements):**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to separate SQL code from user-supplied data. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection.  This requires significant code changes.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Defense-in-Depth):**  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block potential SQL injection attacks. Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities. Ensure the WAF rules are kept up-to-date with the latest threat intelligence.  This provides an additional layer of security, but should *not* be considered a substitute for patching the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the WeGIA application server from other critical systems to limit the potential impact of a successful attack.

*   **Long-Term Security Measures:**

    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Enforce secure coding practices during the development process, including regular code reviews and vulnerability assessments.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to continuously monitor the WeGIA application for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Provide security awareness training to developers and administrators to educate them about common security vulnerabilities and best practices for secure coding and system administration.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users and applications have only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.

**5. Communication:**

*   Communicate the vulnerability and the remediation steps to all relevant stakeholders, including system administrators, developers, and users.
*   Provide clear instructions on how to upgrade the WeGIA application.
*   Inform users about the potential risks associated with the vulnerability and the importance of taking immediate action.

**6. Testing:**

*   After implementing the remediation steps, thoroughly test the application to verify that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed and that all functionality is working as expected.
*   Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

**7. Ongoing Monitoring:**

*   Continuously monitor the WeGIA application and database logs for any suspicious activity, including potential SQL injection attempts.
*   Stay informed about the latest security threats and vulnerabilities and take proactive measures to mitigate them.

**Important Considerations:**

*   The short-term mitigation steps are provided as a temporary measure only. Upgrading to the patched version of WeGIA (3.2.14 or later) is the most effective and recommended solution.
*   Implementing the mitigation steps requires technical expertise. Consult with security professionals if needed.
*   Regularly review and update the security measures to ensure that they remain effective against evolving threats.

By implementing this remediation strategy, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability in the WeGIA application.  Upgrade to the patched version should be prioritized.
