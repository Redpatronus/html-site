#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
CVE-2025-26606 details a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the WeGIA application, specifically affecting the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint. This vulnerability arises from inadequate sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before its incorporation into SQL queries.  A remote attacker can leverage this flaw to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.  Successful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure. The CVSS score indicates a critical severity due to the potential for high impact (data confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and remote exploitability. However, the exploitability score is zero based on the data found on cvedetails.com.

### Remediation
The primary and recommended remediation strategy is to upgrade WeGIA to version 3.2.13 or later. This version contains the fix that addresses the SQL injection vulnerability in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint.

*   **Upgrade WeGIA:** Immediately upgrade the WeGIA installation to version 3.2.13 or any subsequent version containing the patch. Follow the official WeGIA upgrade instructions to ensure a smooth transition.
*   **Verify Upgrade:** After upgrading, thoroughly test the application, especially the `informacao_adicional.php` functionality, to confirm the vulnerability has been successfully remediated.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Continuously monitor the application's logs and database activity for any signs of attempted or successful exploitation. Look for unusual SQL queries or data access patterns.
*   **Database Security Best Practices:** Even after upgrading, implement general database security best practices, such as principle of least privilege and regular security audits, to further mitigate the risk of SQL injection and other database-related attacks.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with SQL injection protection rules to provide an additional layer of security against future attacks.
