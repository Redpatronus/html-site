### Summary
Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type vulnerability in kodeshpa Simplified allows Using Malicious Files. This issue affects Simplified: from n/a through 1.0.6.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The kodeshpa Simplified plugin, in versions up to and including 1.0.6, exhibits an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.  This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including those with dangerous extensions (e.g., .php, .exe, .js, .html), to the server.  Since the exploitability and impact score is 0, it indicates there are not enough details to evaluate the impact.

### Remediation
To mitigate this vulnerability, apply the following remediation strategy:

1.  **Upgrade to a patched version:** The most effective solution is to upgrade the Simplified plugin to a version higher than 1.0.6. Check the plugin vendor's website or the WordPress plugin repository for updates.

2.  **Implement file type validation:**  Implement strict file type validation on the server side.  This should include a whitelist of allowed file extensions, and any files with extensions not on the whitelist should be rejected. Ensure that validation happens *after* the upload has completed or that the file will not be stored if validation failed.

3.  **Implement file size limits:** Restrict the maximum file size allowed for uploads. This can help prevent denial-of-service attacks or the uploading of excessively large malicious files.

4.  **Store uploaded files outside of the webroot:** Configure the web server so that uploaded files are stored in a directory outside of the web server's document root. This will prevent uploaded files from being directly executed by the web server, mitigating the risk of code execution vulnerabilities.

5.  **Sanitize filenames:** Sanitize uploaded filenames to remove any potentially malicious characters or patterns.  This can help prevent directory traversal attacks or other exploits.

6.  **Implement access controls:** Limit access to the upload directory to only authorized users.
