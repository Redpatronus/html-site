## CVE-2025-26793: Hirsch Enterphone MESH Default Credentials Vulnerability

This document outlines the vulnerability, its severity, potential exploits, and mitigation/remediation strategies for CVE-2025-26793, affecting Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH systems.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

The Hirsch Enterphone MESH Web GUI configuration panel, versions up to and including 2024, ships with hardcoded default credentials: username "freedom" and password "viscount".  The system does not enforce or prominently guide administrators to change these credentials upon initial configuration. Changing the credentials is also a multi-step process, further discouraging administrators from securing their systems.  This allows unauthorized access to the system.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score: 10.0 (Critical)**  (Based on the provided data)
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability allows attackers to gain full administrative access to the Enterphone MESH system. This access allows an attacker to:
    *   Control door access.
    *   Potentially monitor audio and video feeds (if equipped).
    *   Access resident information (Personally Identifiable Information - PII).
    *   Potentially disrupt the entire system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network (Accessible over the internet)
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (Default credentials, readily available)
*   **Privileges Required:** None (Default credentials bypass authentication)
*   **User Interaction:** None
*   **Scope:** Changed (Compromise extends beyond the immediate device to potentially impact multiple buildings and residents.)
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** High (PII disclosure)
*   **Integrity Impact:** High (Control over door access, system settings)
*   **Availability Impact:** High (Denial of service possible)

**3. Known Exploit:**

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by:

1.  Identifying Enterphone MESH systems exposed to the internet.
2.  Attempting to log in to the `mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet` interface using the default credentials ("freedom", "viscount").
3.  Upon successful login, the attacker gains complete administrative control.

**4. Remediation/Mitigation Strategy:**

The primary goal is to immediately eliminate the risk posed by the default credentials. This requires a multi-pronged approach:

*   **Immediate Action: Change Default Credentials (Mandatory)**
    *   **Priority:**  Urgent - MUST be implemented immediately.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Log into the Enterphone MESH Web GUI using the default credentials (freedom, viscount).
        2.  Immediately change both the username and password. Use a strong, unique password following best practices (minimum 12 characters, upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
        3.  Document the new credentials securely.
        4.  *Repeat this process for every Enterphone MESH system deployed.*
    *   **Verification:** Verify successful login with the new credentials and inability to log in with the default credentials.

*   **Network Security Hardening:**
    *   **Action:**  Restrict access to the `mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet` interface.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Implement firewall rules to allow access to the Enterphone MESH Web GUI only from trusted IP addresses or networks (e.g., a dedicated administrative network).
        2.  If remote access is required, utilize a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with strong authentication and encryption.
    *   **Rationale:** Limiting network access reduces the attack surface and makes it significantly harder for attackers to reach the vulnerable interface.

*   **Account Management Policies & Procedures:**
    *   **Action:** Develop and enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Implement a formal password policy that mandates:
            *   Minimum password length.
            *   Password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
            *   Regular password changes (e.g., every 90 days).
            *   Prohibition of using default credentials or easily guessable passwords.
        2.  Provide training to system administrators on password security best practices.
    *   **Rationale:**  Enforces a culture of strong authentication and reduces the likelihood of weak or default passwords being used.

*   **Firmware Updates (If Available):**
    *   **Action:**  Apply any available firmware updates from Hirsch/Identiv/Viscount.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Contact Hirsch/Identiv/Viscount support to inquire about available firmware updates that address this vulnerability.
        2.  Follow the vendor's instructions for applying the firmware update.
        3.  Thoroughly test the system after the update to ensure functionality.
    *   **Rationale:**  Firmware updates may include security patches that address the underlying vulnerability and improve overall system security.

*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Action:**  Implement robust logging and monitoring.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Enable detailed logging on the Enterphone MESH system to record all login attempts, configuration changes, and other relevant events.
        2.  Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system or other monitoring solution to analyze logs for suspicious activity (e.g., brute-force login attempts, unauthorized access).
        3.  Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential security incidents.
    *   **Rationale:**  Early detection of malicious activity allows for a faster response and minimizes potential damage.

*   **Vendor Communication:**
    *   **Action:**  Maintain communication with Hirsch/Identiv/Viscount.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Subscribe to the vendor's security advisories and notifications.
        2.  Report any suspected security incidents to the vendor.
        3.  Engage with the vendor to understand their roadmap for addressing security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rationale:** Staying informed about the vendor's security efforts ensures timely access to updates and patches.

*   **Auditing:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct regular security audits.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Perform periodic security audits of the Enterphone MESH system to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that security controls are effective.
        2.  Engage a qualified security consultant to conduct a penetration test to identify exploitable weaknesses.
    *   **Rationale:** Proactive security assessments help identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

**5. Supplier's Perspective Consideration:**

While the supplier's perspective is that "vulnerable systems are not following manufacturers' recommendations to change the default password," this does not absolve them of responsibility.  The lack of a strong prompt or enforced password change upon initial configuration creates a significant security risk.  The provided recommendations aim to mitigate this risk, regardless of adherence to manufacturer recommendations.

**6. Ongoing Maintenance:**

Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update these remediation strategies to adapt to evolving threats and vulnerabilities.  Ensure that administrators receive ongoing security training and are aware of the latest security best practices.
