### Summary
The Web GUI configuration panel of Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH through 2024 ships with default credentials (username freedom, password viscount). The administrator is not prompted to change these credentials on initial configuration, and changing the credentials requires many steps. Attackers can use the credentials over the Internet via mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet to gain access to dozens of Canadian and U.S. apartment buildings and obtain building residents' PII. NOTE: the Supplier's perspective is that the "vulnerable systems are not following manufacturers' recommendations to change the default password."

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 10.0
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0


### Details 
The vulnerability in Hirsch Enterphone MESH, versions through 2024, stems from the use of hardcoded default credentials ("freedom"/"viscount") for accessing the web GUI configuration panel. The software does not enforce or readily prompt for a password change during the initial setup. This allows unauthorized attackers to potentially gain administrative access by exploiting these default credentials. This access can be leveraged over the internet via the `mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet`, potentially compromising the privacy of building residents by exposing their Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The vendor's perspective is that adherence to manufacturer's recommendations of changing the default passwords will resolve the vulnerability.

### Remediation
The primary remediation strategy is to immediately change the default credentials. Follow these steps:

1.  **Access the Web GUI:** Log in to the Enterphone MESH web administration interface using the default username ("freedom") and password ("viscount").

2.  **Change the Default Credentials:**  Change the default username and password to strong, unique values. Consult the Hirsch Enterphone MESH documentation for the precise procedure. Given the description mentioning "many steps," locate the relevant documentation and follow each step carefully.

3.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement a policy that mandates strong passwords and regular password changes for all user accounts, including administrative accounts.

4.  **Network Segmentation:**  If feasible, segment the Enterphone MESH network from other networks to limit the impact of a potential compromise. This can prevent lateral movement within the larger network.

5.  **Disable Remote Access (If Unnecessary):** If remote access to the Enterphone MESH web administration interface is not required, disable it to minimize the attack surface.

6.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Monitor network traffic for any suspicious activity that may indicate unauthorized access to the Enterphone MESH system.

7. **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Ensure that the Enterphone MESH software is running the latest version. Check with Hirsch for any updates or patches that address security vulnerabilities, including the prompting for credential changes on initial setup or simplifying the process.

8. **Review Security Best Practices Documentation:** Refer to Hirsch's official documentation for security best practices for the Enterphone MESH system.
