## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26793

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategies for CVE-2025-26793, a critical vulnerability affecting Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH systems.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-26793
* **Description:** The Web GUI configuration panel of Hirsch Enterphone MESH systems ships with default credentials (username `freedom`, password `viscount`).  The system does not enforce or strongly suggest changing these credentials during initial setup. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system if the default credentials remain unchanged.  This access can be achieved remotely via `mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet`.
* **Affected Products:** Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH systems through version 2024.
* **Root Cause:**  Use of hardcoded default credentials and inadequate security measures during initial device configuration.  Lack of proactive prompts and a complex process for changing the default password exacerbates the issue.

**2. Severity Assessment:**

* **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical) - Based on the information provided.  A CVSS score of 10.0 signifies maximum severity.
* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality:** High - Attackers can access sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of building residents.
    * **Integrity:** High - Attackers can potentially modify system configurations, manipulate door access controls, and compromise the security of the entire system.
    * **Availability:** High - Attackers could potentially disable the system, denying legitimate users access to the building.

**3. Known Exploits:**

* Attackers can use the default credentials (`freedom` / `viscount`) to log in to the web interface via `mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet`.  This access grants them administrative privileges, allowing them to control the system.
* The vulnerability is easily exploitable as the default credentials are widely known and the exploitation requires minimal technical expertise.  The remote accessibility of the web interface via the Internet significantly increases the attack surface.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary goal is to immediately prevent unauthorized access by eliminating the use of default credentials and strengthening authentication.

* **Immediate Actions (Within 24 Hours):**
    * **Change Default Credentials:**  **CRITICAL:** Immediately change the default username and password on all affected Hirsch Enterphone MESH systems.  Implement a strong, unique password that adheres to industry best practices (e.g., minimum length, complexity, no easily guessable patterns).  This is the most important step.
    * **Disable Remote Access (If Possible):**  If remote administration is not essential, temporarily disable remote access to the web interface (mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet) until further security measures are implemented. This will reduce the attack surface.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Place the Enterphone MESH system on a separate VLAN, isolating it from other critical network resources. This limits the potential damage from a successful attack.
    * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to the Enterphone MESH system.  Implement rules to detect and block attempts to access the system using the default credentials.

* **Short-Term Actions (Within 1 Week):**
    * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Enable two-factor authentication for all administrative accounts on the system.  This adds an extra layer of security beyond just username and password.  If the Hirsch Enterphone MESH system does not natively support 2FA, consider placing it behind a reverse proxy that provides this functionality.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement strict ACLs on the firewall to limit access to the web interface only to authorized IP addresses or networks.
    * **Security Audit:** Conduct a thorough security audit of the Enterphone MESH system configuration and network environment.  Identify any other potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    * **Firmware Updates:**  Check for and install any available firmware updates from Hirsch.  These updates may contain security patches that address the vulnerability.
    * **Password Policy Enforcement:** Implement a password policy that enforces strong passwords, requires regular password changes, and prevents the reuse of previous passwords.
    * **User Training:**  Provide training to system administrators on the importance of security best practices, including strong passwords, secure remote access, and regular security audits.

* **Long-Term Actions (Within 1 Month):**
    * **Vendor Coordination:**  Contact Hirsch (or Identiv/Viscount) to inquire about a permanent fix for the vulnerability and request a more secure initial configuration process.  Advocate for stronger default security settings and improved security documentation.
    * **Vulnerability Management Program:** Implement a formal vulnerability management program to regularly scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in all network devices and applications.
    * **Regular Security Assessments:**  Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address security weaknesses proactively.
    * **Implement a Jump Server:** Configure access to the admin portal through a jump server/bastion host requiring MFA and strict ACLs.
    * **Monitor Logs:** Continuously monitor system logs for unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity.
    * **Automated Password Rotation:** Where supported, automate password rotation to further reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

**5. Mitigation Considerations:**

* **Impact on Functionality:** Some mitigation steps, such as disabling remote access, may temporarily impact the functionality of the system.  Carefully assess the impact of each mitigation step before implementing it.
* **User Experience:** Implementing strong password policies and two-factor authentication may require additional effort from users.  Communicate clearly with users about the importance of these security measures.
* **Cost:** Some mitigation steps, such as purchasing a reverse proxy or hiring a security consultant, may involve costs.  Prioritize mitigation steps based on risk and budget.

**6. Supplier's Perspective and Responsibility:**

While the supplier has stated that the "vulnerable systems are not following manufacturers' recommendations to change the default password," this statement does not absolve them of responsibility.  The fact that the system ships with easily exploitable default credentials and lacks sufficient security measures during initial configuration is a significant security flaw. The vendor should:

* Provide clearer and more prominent instructions for changing the default password.
* Implement features that force or strongly encourage users to change the default password during initial setup.
* Investigate options for generating unique default passwords for each device during manufacturing.
* Simplify the process of changing the administrative password.

**7. Monitoring and Verification:**

* Regularly monitor system logs for unauthorized access attempts.
* Perform periodic vulnerability scans to verify that the implemented mitigation measures are effective.
* Retest the system after applying firmware updates or other security patches.

By implementing these remediation and mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation of CVE-2025-26793 and protect the sensitive data of building residents.  It is crucial to prioritize these actions and address the vulnerability as quickly as possible.
