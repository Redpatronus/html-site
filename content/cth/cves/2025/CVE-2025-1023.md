### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The `EditEventTypes.php` file within ChurchCRM is vulnerable to a time-based blind SQL injection attack via the `newCountName` parameter. Specifically, the application directly concatenates the unsanitized input from the `newCountName` parameter into an SQL query. This allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary SQL code, effectively bypassing intended security measures. Due to the time-based nature, attackers can infer information about the database by observing the response times to injected queries. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the entire ChurchCRM database. The vulnerability resides in how the application constructs and executes the SQL query for adding new event types, neglecting to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input. The injected SQL code is executed with the privileges of the database user ChurchCRM is using to connect, increasing the severity of a successful exploitation.

### Remediation

To remediate this SQL Injection vulnerability, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade to a patched version:**  Upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a fix for CVE-2025-1023, if a patch is available. Check the ChurchCRM project website or security advisories for updates. This is the most effective solution.

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input sanitization and validation for all user-supplied data, especially the `newCountName` parameter in `EditEventTypes.php`. Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) or escaping functions provided by the database system to prevent SQL injection.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user ChurchCRM uses to connect has the minimum necessary privileges to perform its required tasks. Avoid granting it unnecessary administrative or high-level privileges, limiting the impact of a successful SQL injection.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests containing SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules that identify and block common SQL injection patterns.

5.  **Code Review:**  Conduct a thorough code review of the `EditEventTypes.php` file and any related code that handles user input and database interactions. Identify and correct any other instances where user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the ChurchCRM application.

7.  **Disable Feature (Temporary Workaround):** As a temporary measure, if immediate patching is not possible, consider disabling the functionality related to adding new event types.  This will prevent exploitation until a proper fix can be implemented. This is a last resort, as it impacts functionality.
