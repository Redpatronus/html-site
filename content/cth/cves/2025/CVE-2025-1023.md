### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists within the `EditEventTypes.php` file of ChurchCRM. When a user attempts to create or edit an event type, the `newCountName` parameter, which is intended to specify the name of the event type, is directly incorporated into an SQL query. Because the application fails to sanitize or validate this parameter, a malicious actor can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. By carefully crafting a `newCountName` string containing SQL commands, an attacker can manipulate the database to perform unauthorized actions, such as extracting sensitive information (usernames, passwords, financial data), modifying existing records, or even deleting critical tables. The time-based aspect implies the attacker uses timing mechanisms to infer information about the database's state by observing the server's response time to injected SQL queries that conditionally introduce delays. Due to the elevated privileges typically associated with database access, a successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the ChurchCRM system.

### Details
The vulnerability resides within the `EditEventTypes.php` file in ChurchCRM. Specifically, the `newCountName` parameter, when modified within the Edit Event Types functionality, is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application directly concatenates the user-supplied `newCountName` value into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `newCountName` parameter. This can lead to unauthorized database access, data manipulation, or complete system compromise. Exploitation requires an authenticated user with the ability to edit event types. The attacker can craft a malicious payload within the `newCountName` field, which, upon being processed, injects the attacker's SQL commands into the database query. Due to the time-based blind nature, an attacker would rely on timing-based techniques to infer the results of their injected SQL commands.
=======
### Details
The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `newCountName` parameter within the EditEventTypes functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Because the injection is time-based blind SQL injection, the attacker might not receive direct error messages or output from the database, but can infer information based on the time it takes for the server to respond to specially crafted requests. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential compromise of the entire ChurchCRM application and underlying system. The lack of sanitization and direct concatenation into the SQL query are the root causes of the vulnerability.

### Remediation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following steps should be taken:

<<<<<<< ours
1.  **Upgrade to a patched version:** The most effective solution is to upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a fix for this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM project website or official channels for the latest patched version. If an upgrade is not immediately feasible, consider implementing the following workarounds.

To mitigate the risk of CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation steps are recommended:
=======
1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses this SQL injection vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website for security updates and release notes.  Applying the latest patch released by the vendor is the preferred solution.
>>>>>>> theirs

<<<<<<< ours
2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation mechanisms for the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes.php` file. This should involve:
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for the `newCountName` parameter. Reject any input that contains characters outside of this whitelist.
    *   **Escaping:** Properly escape all user-supplied input before including it in SQL queries. Use database-specific escaping functions (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string` for MySQL) to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Replace direct string concatenation with parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures that user-supplied input is treated as data rather than executable code.

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to the latest version of ChurchCRM that includes a patch for this vulnerability. Check the official ChurchCRM website or repository for available updates. If an update is not yet available, consider implementing the following mitigations.
=======
2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially the `newCountName` parameter in the EditEventTypes functionality. This should include:
    *   **Whitelist Validation:** Validate that the input conforms to an expected whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
    *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize the input by escaping special characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons).

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules that specifically target the `newCountName` parameter and other potential injection points.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `newCountName` parameter. Ensure that all user inputs are properly escaped and filtered before being used in SQL queries. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which treat user inputs as data rather than executable code, thus preventing SQL injection.
=======
3.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries. Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user input, preventing SQL injection attacks.
