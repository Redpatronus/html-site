### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `newCountName` parameter into an SQL query within the `EditEventTypes` functionality of ChurchCRM.  Specifically, when creating or modifying event types, the application fails to properly sanitize or validate the input provided for the `newCountName` parameter. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter, which is then executed by the database server. This allows the attacker to perform unauthorized database operations, including reading sensitive data, modifying existing records, or even deleting data.  Due to the time-based blind nature of the SQL injection, the attacker relies on observing the application's response time to infer the results of the injected SQL queries. This requires careful crafting of payloads to induce delays based on conditional logic within the database, making exploitation somewhat complex, but still highly impactful.

### Remediation
To mitigate the risk of CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation steps are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** The most effective solution is to upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses this vulnerability.  Check the ChurchCRM website for the latest version and security updates.

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user-supplied input, especially the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes` functionality. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. This ensures that user-provided data is treated as data and not as executable code.

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has only the necessary privileges to perform its required operations. Avoid granting excessive permissions that could be exploited in the event of a successful SQL injection attack.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting known SQL injection vulnerabilities. Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to protect against SQL injection attacks.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the ChurchCRM installation and associated infrastructure.

6. **Disable/Restrict Access:** If immediate patching is not feasible, consider temporarily disabling or restricting access to the `EditEventTypes` functionality until a patch can be applied. This can significantly reduce the attack surface.
