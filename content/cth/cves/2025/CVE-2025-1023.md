### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.1.3 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The vulnerability resides within the `EditEventTypes.php` file in ChurchCRM. When creating or editing event types, the `newCountName` parameter, supplied via a POST request, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization. This allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary SQL code within the `newCountName` parameter. By carefully crafting the injected SQL, an attacker can perform actions such as:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Extract sensitive information from the ChurchCRM database, including user credentials, financial data, and personal information of members.
*   **Data Modification:** Modify existing data within the database, potentially altering event details, membership records, or financial transactions.
*   **Data Deletion:** Delete critical data from the database, rendering the ChurchCRM system unusable.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution (Potentially):** Depending on the database server's configuration and permissions, the attacker may be able to execute operating system commands on the server.

The exploitation is made easier due to the time-based nature of the blind SQL injection, making detection harder. This vulnerability affects all deployments of ChurchCRM version 5.1.3 and earlier that allow public access to the EditEventTypes functionality (whether authenticated or not).

### Remediation

To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** The most effective solution is to upgrade to the latest version of ChurchCRM. Check the [ChurchCRM website](https://www.churchcrm.io/) for the newest release and upgrade instructions.  The developers are likely to have patched this SQL injection vulnerability in a subsequent version.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially the `newCountName` parameter in `EditEventTypes.php`. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  Ensure all special characters are properly escaped before being used in SQL queries.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic and block SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF to detect and block SQL injection patterns.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid granting unnecessary permissions that could be abused by an attacker.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the ChurchCRM system.

6. **Disable or restrict access**: Disable or restrict access to EditEventTypes functionality
