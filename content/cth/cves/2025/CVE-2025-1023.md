### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `newCountName` parameter within the EditEventTypes functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Because the injection is time-based blind SQL injection, the attacker might not receive direct error messages or output from the database, but can infer information based on the time it takes for the server to respond to specially crafted requests. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, data breaches, and potential compromise of the entire ChurchCRM application and underlying system. The lack of sanitization and direct concatenation into the SQL query are the root causes of the vulnerability.

### Remediation
To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation strategy is recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses this SQL injection vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website for security updates and release notes.  Applying the latest patch released by the vendor is the preferred solution.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially the `newCountName` parameter in the EditEventTypes functionality. This should include:
    *   **Whitelist Validation:** Validate that the input conforms to an expected whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
    *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize the input by escaping special characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons).

3.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries. Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user input, preventing SQL injection attacks.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. Avoid granting the database user account excessive permissions that could be abused if a SQL injection vulnerability is exploited.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules to identify and prevent common SQL injection patterns.

6.  **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.

7.  **Security Testing:** Perform regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address security weaknesses in the application.
