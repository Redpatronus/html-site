### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability resides within the `EditEventTypes.php` file in ChurchCRM. When adding or modifying event types, the application directly incorporates the `newCountName` parameter into an SQL query without proper input validation or sanitization. This unsanitized input allows for the injection of malicious SQL code. An attacker can craft a specially crafted `newCountName` value containing SQL commands, which, when executed by the application, can grant unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the underlying database server. The time-based blind SQL injection aspect means the attacker may not see direct output from the database but can infer results based on timing delays caused by injected SQL commands like `SLEEP()`. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the ChurchCRM database and the application as a whole.

### Remediation

To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** The primary and most effective solution is to upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses the vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM project website for the latest stable release and upgrade instructions. Since no patched version is currently listed on cvedetails.com for this theoretical CVE, assume the fix will be available in a future version.

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes.php` file. This should include:
    *   **Whitelist Validation:** Only allow alphanumeric characters and a limited set of safe special characters (e.g., spaces, hyphens).
    *   **SQL Encoding:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL queries. This ensures that the database treats the input as data, not as SQL commands.
    *   **Escaping:** If parameterized queries are not feasible, properly escape the input using database-specific escaping functions (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string()` for MySQL).

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the ChurchCRM application. Configure the WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts. Ensure that the WAF rules are regularly updated to stay ahead of emerging attack patterns.

4.  **Database Permissions:** Implement the principle of least privilege for the database user account used by ChurchCRM. Grant the user only the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions, minimizing the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

5.  **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the `EditEventTypes.php` file and other areas where user input is incorporated into SQL queries. Identify and address any other instances of potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

6. **Monitor and Alert:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious database activity, such as unusual query patterns or database errors. This can help to identify and respond to potential attacks in a timely manner.

7.  **Time-based Blind SQL Injection Mitigation**: Implement measures to prevent time-based blind SQL injection. This can include:
    *   **Disable or Restrict Stored Procedures**: Limit the ability to use stored procedures or functions like `SLEEP()` within the SQL database if they are not required.
    *   **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on requests to prevent attackers from sending a large number of requests in a short period, which is often necessary for successful time-based attacks.
    *   **Response Time Monitoring**: Monitor response times for requests to detect unusual delays that might indicate a time-based SQL injection attack.
