### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `newCountName` parameter within the `EditEventTypes` functionality of ChurchCRM. This parameter is directly used in constructing SQL queries.  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter. Due to the time-based blind nature of the SQL injection, the attacker can infer the results of their queries by observing the response time of the server. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the database, including reading sensitive information (like user credentials, personal data), modifying data, or even deleting tables. The vulnerable code is located within the `EditEventTypes` page, where the `newCountName` POST parameter is used to dynamically construct a SQL query for adding or modifying event types. The lack of parameterized queries or proper escaping mechanisms makes it susceptible to SQL injection.

### Remediation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following steps should be taken:

1.  **Upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM:** The most effective solution is to upgrade to a version of ChurchCRM that includes a fix for this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website or release notes for updates.  This usually involves downloading the new version and following the upgrade instructions.
2.  **Implement Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs, especially the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes` functionality. Use appropriate input validation techniques to ensure that only valid data is passed to the database query. Specifically:
    *   **Whitelist Validation:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and data types for the `newCountName` parameter.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to this whitelist.
    *   **Escape Special Characters:** Escape any special characters that could be interpreted as SQL control characters.
3.  **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Replace the direct concatenation of user input into SQL queries with parameterized queries or prepared statements. Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user-supplied data, preventing SQL injection attacks.
4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rulesets that can detect and block SQL injection attempts.  Configure the WAF to monitor traffic to the ChurchCRM application and block any suspicious requests.
5.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has only the necessary privileges to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting the database user account unnecessary administrative privileges, which could limit the damage from a successful SQL injection attack.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the ChurchCRM installation to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
