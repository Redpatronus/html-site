### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input in the `newCountName` parameter when editing event types. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.  Specifically, the `EditEventTypes.php` script concatenates the `newCountName` directly into an SQL UPDATE statement.  By crafting a specific payload within the `newCountName` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the ChurchCRM database. Due to the time-based nature of the injection, an attacker can deduce information about the database structure and content through timing analysis, even without direct visibility of the query results. This can result in complete compromise of the application and the data it stores.

### Remediation

To mitigate the SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-1023) in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior, the following remediation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses the vulnerability. Check the official ChurchCRM website for updates and security advisories.  This is the most effective long-term solution.
2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes.php` script.  Specifically:
    *   **Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):**  Replace direct string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements).  This separates the SQL code from the data, preventing SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Implement a whitelist to only allow certain characters or patterns in the `newCountName` parameter.  If the acceptable values follow a predictable pattern, this is a highly effective defense.
    *   **Escaping Special Characters:** If prepared statements are not immediately feasible, properly escape special characters (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, backslashes) in the `newCountName` parameter before using it in the SQL query.  However, this method is less robust than prepared statements and requires careful implementation.
3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.  Configure the WAF to monitor traffic to the `EditEventTypes.php` script and block requests containing suspicious SQL syntax.
4.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has only the necessary permissions. Avoid granting the user account unnecessary privileges that could be exploited in the event of a successful SQL injection attack.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits of the ChurchCRM installation to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
