### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.1.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details 
The time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists within the `EditEventTypes.php` file of ChurchCRM. When a user attempts to create or edit an event type, the `newCountName` parameter, which is intended to specify the name of the event type, is directly incorporated into an SQL query. Because the application fails to sanitize or validate this parameter, a malicious actor can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. By carefully crafting a `newCountName` string containing SQL commands, an attacker can manipulate the database to perform unauthorized actions, such as extracting sensitive information (usernames, passwords, financial data), modifying existing records, or even deleting critical tables. The time-based aspect implies the attacker uses timing mechanisms to infer information about the database's state by observing the server's response time to injected SQL queries that conditionally introduce delays. Due to the elevated privileges typically associated with database access, a successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the ChurchCRM system.

### Remediation
To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation strategy is recommended:

1.  **Upgrade to a patched version:** The most effective solution is to upgrade ChurchCRM to a version that includes a fix for this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM project website or official channels for the latest patched version. If an upgrade is not immediately feasible, consider implementing the following workarounds.

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation mechanisms for the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes.php` file. This should involve:
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for the `newCountName` parameter. Reject any input that contains characters outside of this whitelist.
    *   **Escaping:** Properly escape all user-supplied input before including it in SQL queries. Use database-specific escaping functions (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string` for MySQL) to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Replace direct string concatenation with parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures that user-supplied input is treated as data rather than executable code.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules that specifically target the `newCountName` parameter and other potential injection points.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has only the necessary privileges to perform its intended functions. Granting excessive privileges can amplify the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the ChurchCRM system. This proactive approach helps to ensure the ongoing security of the application.

6.  **Monitor database activity:** Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious database activity, such as unusual queries or unauthorized access attempts.
