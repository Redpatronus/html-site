### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability lies in the `EditEventTypes.php` file of ChurchCRM. When a user attempts to add a new event type, the value provided for `newCountName` is directly inserted into an SQL query.  An attacker can craft a malicious `newCountName` value containing SQL code that, when concatenated, alters the query's intended function. Because it's a time-based blind SQL injection, the attacker won't see direct output, but can infer results based on the time the server takes to respond, based on injected `SLEEP()` commands. This allows the attacker to probe the database structure, extract sensitive information (usernames, passwords, other data), modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server, depending on the database user's permissions. The lack of input validation or sanitization on the `newCountName` parameter is the root cause of this vulnerability.

### Remediation
To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation steps should be taken:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses this vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website or security advisories for the latest secure version.  If a patched version is not immediately available, consider the following workarounds.

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes.php` file. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  Parameterize the `newCountName` value to prevent it from being interpreted as SQL code.

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure the database user account used by ChurchCRM has the minimum necessary privileges required to perform its functions. Avoid granting the database user unnecessary permissions, such as the ability to create or drop tables.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting this vulnerability. Configure the WAF with rules that identify and prevent SQL injection attacks.

5.  **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the `EditEventTypes.php` file and other areas where user input is used in SQL queries. Look for instances where input is not properly sanitized or parameterized.

6.  **Disable/Restrict Functionality (Temporary Workaround):** As a temporary measure, consider disabling or restricting access to the `EditEventTypes` functionality until a permanent fix is implemented. This will reduce the attack surface.

7.  **Monitor Logs:**  Actively monitor application logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual SQL queries or errors.
