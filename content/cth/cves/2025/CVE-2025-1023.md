### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.1.3 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: False

### Details
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `newCountName` parameter within the `EditEventTypes` functionality. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of escaping or filtering. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter. Due to the blind nature of the SQL injection, the attacker cannot directly see the output of their queries. Instead, they use time-based techniques (e.g., using `SLEEP()` or `WAITFOR DELAY`) to infer information based on the time it takes for the server to respond.  Successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, modify database records, or even execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server if the database user has sufficient privileges. The vulnerability is present in ChurchCRM versions 5.1.3 and earlier. The exploitability score is low because exploitation is hard and needs good expertise with timing attacks.

### Remediation

To mitigate the risk associated with CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** The most effective solution is to upgrade to a patched version of ChurchCRM that addresses this SQL injection vulnerability. Check the ChurchCRM website or official channels for the latest version and security updates.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied input, particularly the `newCountName` parameter in the `EditEventTypes` functionality.  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Escaping user input before including it in SQL queries will help prevent attacks by making sure the user-provided input is treated as literal text rather than as commands.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting the SQL injection vulnerability.  Configure the WAF with rules to identify and prevent SQL injection attempts.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by ChurchCRM has only the minimum required privileges necessary for its operation.  Limit the user's access to only the required tables and operations to minimize the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

5.  **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the ChurchCRM codebase to identify and address any other potential SQL injection vulnerabilities or other security weaknesses.

6.  **Database Monitoring:** Implement database monitoring to detect and alert on suspicious database activity, such as unusual SQL queries or unauthorized data access.
