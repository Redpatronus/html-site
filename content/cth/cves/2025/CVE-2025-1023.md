### Summary
A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the EditEventTypes functionality. The newCountName parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 9.3
- **Exploitability Score**: 0.0
- **Impact Score**: 0.0
- **Exploitable**: 0

### Details
The vulnerability resides within the `EditEventTypes.php` file in ChurchCRM. Specifically, the `newCountName` parameter, when modified within the Edit Event Types functionality, is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application directly concatenates the user-supplied `newCountName` value into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `newCountName` parameter. This can lead to unauthorized database access, data manipulation, or complete system compromise. Exploitation requires an authenticated user with the ability to edit event types. The attacker can craft a malicious payload within the `newCountName` field, which, upon being processed, injects the attacker's SQL commands into the database query. Due to the time-based blind nature, an attacker would rely on timing-based techniques to infer the results of their injected SQL commands.

### Remediation

To mitigate the risk of CVE-2025-1023, the following remediation steps are recommended:

1.  **Upgrade ChurchCRM:** Upgrade to the latest version of ChurchCRM that includes a patch for this vulnerability. Check the official ChurchCRM website or repository for available updates. If an update is not yet available, consider implementing the following mitigations.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `newCountName` parameter. Ensure that all user inputs are properly escaped and filtered before being used in SQL queries. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which treat user inputs as data rather than executable code, thus preventing SQL injection.

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that database users and application users have only the necessary privileges required to perform their tasks. Restricting access to sensitive data and system functionalities can minimize the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting the vulnerability. Configure the WAF with rules to identify and block SQL injection attempts, including those targeting the `newCountName` parameter.

5.  **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of the `EditEventTypes.php` file and other relevant parts of the application to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.

7.  **Implement Time-based Blind SQL Injection Detection:** Create or enable mechanisms to detect anomalies in query execution times, indicating a potential time-based blind SQL injection attempt. This could involve monitoring query performance and alerting administrators when unusual delays are detected.
