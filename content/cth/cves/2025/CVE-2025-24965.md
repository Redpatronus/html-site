### Summary
crun is an open source OCI Container Runtime fully written in C. In affected versions A malicious container image could trick the krun handler into escaping the root filesystem, allowing file creation or modification on the host. No special permissions are needed, only the ability for the current user to write to the target file. The problem is fixed in crun 1.20 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 8.5
- **Exploitability Score**: 2.0
- **Impact Score**: 6.0
- **Exploitable**: Yes

### Details 
CVE-2025-24965 is a critical vulnerability affecting crun, an OCI container runtime. It allows a malicious container image to escape the root filesystem due to improper handling of file paths or namespaces by the krun handler. This escape allows an attacker to create or modify files on the host system outside of the container's intended scope. This vulnerability is exploitable by any user capable of writing to the target file and requires no special privileges.  The specific flaw resides in how crun handles certain container configurations or filesystem interactions when using the krun handler.  Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary file modification or creation on the host filesystem. The vulnerable software configuration depends on using crun with the krun handler and being exposed to potentially malicious container images.

### Remediation
The primary and recommended remediation is to upgrade crun to version 1.20 or later. This version contains the fix for the described vulnerability.

**Steps to Remediate:**

1.  **Identify Affected Systems:** Determine all systems running crun and which version is installed. Use a package manager or crun's version command (`crun --version`) to identify the current version.

2.  **Upgrade crun:** Upgrade crun to version 1.20 or later. Use your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `apk`) or follow the official crun documentation for installation instructions. Example using `apt`:
        sudo apt update
    sudo apt install crun
        (Make sure your package manager pulls version 1.20 or newer)

3.  **Verify the Upgrade:** After the upgrade, verify the new version is running by using:
        crun --version
    
4.  **Rebuild and Redeploy Containers (if necessary):** If you suspect any containers might have been built using malicious images, consider rebuilding those containers using trusted base images and re-deploying them with the patched crun version. This is to ensure no lingering malicious files exist within your container images.

5.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** After applying the patch, closely monitor your systems and container logs for any unusual or suspicious activity that may indicate attempted exploitation prior to patching. Review file system access patterns, especially those originating from within containers.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Implement regular security audits of your container infrastructure and the images you use. This includes using image scanning tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in container images before deployment.
