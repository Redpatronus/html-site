## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26788

This document outlines the vulnerability, its severity, known exploits, and recommended remediation and mitigation strategies for CVE-2025-26788 affecting StrongKey FIDO Server.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-26788
*   **Component:** StrongKey FIDO Server
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 4.15.1
*   **Description:** StrongKey FIDO Server before version 4.15.1 incorrectly treats a non-discoverable (namedcredential) flow as a discoverable transaction. This means that operations intended to be associated with a specific, named credential can be inadvertently treated as discoverable credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.  In essence, it fails to properly isolate and protect named credentials as intended.

**2. Severity Assessment:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.4 (High)
    *   **CVSS v3 Vector:**  Assuming the provided CVSS information is complete and correct, this likely translates to something similar to:  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N. This means:
        *   **AV:N (Attack Vector: Network):**  The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
        *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** Exploitation is relatively easy to achieve.
        *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):**  No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
        *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):**  No user interaction is required.
        *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):**  The vulnerability's impact is limited to the affected component.
        *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):**  There is a high impact on confidentiality (sensitive data can be disclosed).
        *   **I:L (Integrity: Low):**  There is a low impact on integrity (data can be slightly modified).
        *   **A:N (Availability: None):**  There is no impact on availability.
*   **Severity Level:** High. Due to the potential for unauthorized access to credentials and information disclosure with relatively low exploitation complexity, this vulnerability poses a significant risk.

**3. Known Exploits and Potential Impact:**

*   **Known Exploits:** The provided information doesn't explicitly state the existence of public exploits. However, the CVSS score and description suggest that developing an exploit is feasible. Consider this vulnerability actively exploitable unless proven otherwise.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Credential Theft/Compromise:** Attackers may gain access to FIDO credentials intended to be private and named.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to systems and applications protected by the FIDO Server.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information associated with the FIDO credentials may be exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can lead to a loss of trust in the FIDO Server and the organization using it.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches and unauthorized access can lead to violations of data protection regulations.

**4. Remediation and Mitigation Strategies:**

**A. Immediate Actions (Within 24-48 Hours):**

*   **Identify Affected Systems:**  Immediately identify all instances of StrongKey FIDO Server running versions prior to 4.15.1 within your environment.
*   **Isolate Vulnerable Systems (If Patching Is Delayed):** If an immediate patch cannot be applied, isolate the vulnerable StrongKey FIDO Server instances from the network to reduce the attack surface.  Consider using network segmentation or firewall rules to limit access.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement monitoring rules to detect any unusual activity related to the StrongKey FIDO Server, such as:
    *   Unexpected access attempts to sensitive resources.
    *   Abnormal authentication patterns.
    *   Changes to user accounts or permissions.
    *   Unusual network traffic to or from the FIDO server.

**B. Long-Term Remediation (Within 1-2 Weeks):**

*   **Apply the Patch:** The primary remediation is to upgrade StrongKey FIDO Server to version 4.15.1 or later.  Follow the vendor's upgrade instructions carefully.
*   **Verify Patch Installation:** After applying the patch, thoroughly verify that the vulnerability has been remediated.  Run penetration tests or vulnerability scans to confirm that the issue is resolved.
*   **Review FIDO Server Configuration:**  After upgrading, review the FIDO Server configuration to ensure that all settings are properly configured according to best practices and the organization's security policies.  Pay particular attention to credential discoverability and named credential settings.

**C. Ongoing Mitigation and Prevention:**

*   **Vulnerability Management Program:** Implement a comprehensive vulnerability management program that includes:
    *   Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
    *   Staying informed about security advisories and updates from vendors.
    *   Promptly patching vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Hardening:**  Implement security hardening measures on the StrongKey FIDO Server, such as:
    *   Disabling unnecessary services and ports.
    *   Using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
    *   Implementing access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive resources.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate the StrongKey FIDO Server from other critical systems.  This can help to limit the impact of a successful attack.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Deploy an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and block potential attacks.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees to educate them about phishing attacks, social engineering, and other common threats.

**5.  Rollback Plan:**

*   Before applying any patches, create a complete backup of the StrongKey FIDO Server configuration and data.
*   Document the steps taken during the patching process.
*   If the patch causes any issues, revert to the previous version of the server using the backup.
*   Investigate the cause of the failure and address it before attempting to apply the patch again.

**6. Communication Plan:**

*   Communicate the vulnerability and its potential impact to all relevant stakeholders, including IT staff, security teams, and management.
*   Provide regular updates on the remediation progress.
*   Establish a communication channel for reporting any security incidents related to the vulnerability.

**7.  Disclaimer:**

This remediation strategy is based on the information provided and general security best practices.  The specific steps required to remediate the vulnerability may vary depending on the organization's environment and configuration.  Consult with security experts and refer to the vendor's documentation for more detailed guidance.
