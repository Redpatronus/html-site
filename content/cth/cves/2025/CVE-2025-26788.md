## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26788

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-26788
*   **Vulnerability:** The StrongKey FIDO Server, in versions prior to 4.15.1, incorrectly handles non-discoverable (namedcredential) flows as discoverable transactions. This can lead to unintended exposure or manipulation of credential information.
*   **Affected Product:** StrongKey FIDO Server
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions before 4.15.1

**2. Severity Assessment:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.4 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:**  *The provided data only gives Base Score, Impact Subscore and Exploitability Subscore. An accurate CVSS Vector needs to be built based on the known exploit information, or from a formal CVSS calculator such as found on the NVD website.* A possible vector would be `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N` (Network, Low Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, Low Integrity Impact, No Availability Impact) which reflects network access, relative ease of exploitation and impact on credential confidentiality and some potential to modify expected operation.
*   **Severity:** High. The improper handling of discoverability can potentially allow unauthorized access to or modification of user credentials.

**3. Known Exploit Information:**

*   *The provided data does not give specific details of a known exploit.* However, the nature of the vulnerability suggests that an attacker could potentially:

    *   **Exploit the misinterpretation of credential types to enumerate or access credentials that were intended to be private and non-discoverable.**
    *   **Manipulate the authentication flow, potentially bypassing security controls.**
    *   **Gain access to sensitive information associated with affected credentials.**

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

*   **Immediate Action:**
    *   **Upgrade StrongKey FIDO Server to version 4.15.1 or later.** This update contains the necessary fix for the vulnerability. This is the primary and recommended remediation step.

*   **Mitigation Steps (if immediate upgrade is not possible):**
    *   **Restrict network access to the StrongKey FIDO Server.** Implement firewall rules to limit access to trusted IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Monitor server logs for suspicious activity.** Look for unusual patterns or attempts to access or enumerate credentials. Analyze authentication logs for unexpected success or failure patterns.
    *   **Review and strengthen existing access control policies.** Ensure that only authorized users have access to credential management functions within the StrongKey FIDO Server.
    *   **Consider disabling the use of non-discoverable (namedcredential) flows if possible**, or closely monitor their usage until the upgrade can be performed.

**5. Long-Term Security Measures:**

*   **Establish a vulnerability management program.** Regularly scan your systems for vulnerabilities and promptly apply security patches.
*   **Subscribe to security advisories from StrongKey.** Stay informed about the latest security updates and vulnerabilities affecting your StrongKey FIDO Server deployment.
*   **Implement security best practices.** Follow industry-recommended security guidelines for configuring and managing your StrongKey FIDO Server environment.
*   **Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.** Identify and address potential security weaknesses in your infrastructure.
*   **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.** MFA can provide an extra layer of security against credential-based attacks.

**6. Verification:**

*   After applying the upgrade or mitigation steps, verify that the vulnerability is no longer exploitable.
*   Test authentication workflows and credential management functions to ensure that they are functioning as expected.
*   Review server logs to confirm that suspicious activity is no longer occurring.

**Important Considerations:**

*   This remediation/mitigation strategy is based on the limited information provided about CVE-2025-26788. A more comprehensive strategy may be required after further investigation and analysis of the vulnerability.
*   Consult the StrongKey documentation and support resources for detailed instructions on upgrading the StrongKey FIDO Server and implementing security best practices.
*   Prioritize the upgrade to version 4.15.1 or later as the most effective way to address this vulnerability.
