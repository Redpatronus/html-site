### Summary
StrongKey FIDO Server before 4.15.1 treats a non-discoverable (namedcredential) flow as a discoverable transaction.

#### Severity
- **Base Score**: 8.4
- **Exploitability Score**: 1.8
- **Impact Score**: 6.0
- **Exploitable**: 0


### Details 
CVE-2025-26788 affects StrongKey FIDO Server versions prior to 4.15.1. The vulnerability arises because the server incorrectly processes non-discoverable (namedcredential) authentication flows as if they were discoverable. This misinterpretation can lead to unintended disclosure of credential information or potentially allow unauthorized access, as the system might bypass expected security checks associated with non-discoverable credentials. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to gain access to accounts or data that should be protected by the intended discoverability settings.

### Remediation
To remediate CVE-2025-26788, upgrade StrongKey FIDO Server to version 4.15.1 or later. The updated version includes a fix that correctly differentiates between discoverable and non-discoverable authentication flows, preventing the incorrect handling of namedcredential transactions. It is crucial to thoroughly test the upgraded system in a staging environment before deploying it to production to ensure compatibility and that the fix effectively addresses the vulnerability without introducing new issues. Follow the vendor's official upgrade instructions to avoid potential complications during the update process.
