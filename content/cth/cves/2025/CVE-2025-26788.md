## Remediation/Mitigation Strategy for CVE-2025-26788

This document outlines the remediation and mitigation strategies for the vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-26788 affecting StrongKey FIDO Server before version 4.15.1.

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

CVE-2025-26788 describes a security flaw in StrongKey FIDO Server versions prior to 4.15.1.  The vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of non-discoverable (namedcredential) flows. The server mistakenly treats these flows as discoverable transactions. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or security breaches.

**2. Severity:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.4 (High)
*   **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (Network, Low Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, User Interaction Required, Changed Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, No Availability Impact)

The high severity indicates a significant risk to the confidentiality and integrity of the system due to potential unauthorized access and data manipulation.  The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), implying that an attacker may need to trick a user into performing an action.

**3. Known Exploit(s):**

While no specific exploit code is mentioned in the provided information, the nature of the vulnerability suggests the following potential attack vector:

*   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** An attacker could craft a phishing email or webpage that tricks a user into initiating a non-discoverable credential transaction.  Because the server misinterprets this as a discoverable transaction, the attacker might be able to leverage this to gain unauthorized access to resources or manipulate data.

**4. Remediation Strategy:**

The primary and most effective remediation is to **upgrade StrongKey FIDO Server to version 4.15.1 or later.**  This version contains the necessary fix to correctly handle non-discoverable credential flows and prevents the vulnerability from being exploited.

*   **Action:** Upgrade StrongKey FIDO Server to version 4.15.1 or the latest available version.
*   **Timeline:** Immediate - Implement the upgrade as soon as possible.
*   **Responsibility:** System Administrators responsible for managing the StrongKey FIDO Server.
*   **Verification:** After the upgrade, thoroughly test the FIDO server functionality, especially related to named credentials and non-discoverable flows, to confirm the vulnerability is resolved.

**5. Mitigation Strategy (If Immediate Upgrade is Not Possible):**

If an immediate upgrade is not feasible, implement the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploitation:

*   **User Awareness Training:**
    *   **Action:**  Educate users about the risks of phishing attacks and social engineering tactics.  Emphasize the importance of verifying the authenticity of websites and emails before entering any credentials or authorizing transactions.
    *   **Timeline:** Within one week.
    *   **Responsibility:** Security team or IT department responsible for user training.
*   **Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Action:**  Implement network segmentation to isolate the FIDO server from other critical systems. This can limit the potential damage if the server is compromised.
    *   **Timeline:** Within two weeks.
    *   **Responsibility:** Network Administrators.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules:**
    *   **Action:** Implement WAF rules to detect and block suspicious requests that might attempt to exploit the vulnerability. Monitor WAF logs for any unusual activity.
    *   **Timeline:** Within one week.
    *   **Responsibility:** Security Engineers/Administrators.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Action:**  Enable comprehensive logging for the StrongKey FIDO Server and monitor logs for any suspicious activity related to credential creation or authentication flows.  Pay close attention to events that indicate the server is misinterpreting transaction types.
    *   **Timeline:** Ongoing.
    *   **Responsibility:** Security Operations Center (SOC) or Security Administrators.

**6.  Rollback Plan:**

*   In the event of an unsuccessful upgrade, have a rollback plan in place to revert to the previous version of StrongKey FIDO Server.  Ensure a recent backup of the server configuration and data is available.

**7. Communication Plan:**

*   Communicate the vulnerability and remediation plan to all stakeholders, including users, IT staff, and management.

**8. Post-Remediation/Mitigation Monitoring:**

*   Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the implemented remediation and mitigation measures. Regularly review security logs, conduct vulnerability scans, and perform penetration testing to identify any potential weaknesses.
*   Stay informed about any new information or exploits related to this vulnerability and adjust the mitigation strategy accordingly.

By implementing these remediation and mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the risk associated with CVE-2025-26788 and protect their FIDO server infrastructure. Remember that the most effective solution is to upgrade to the latest version of StrongKey FIDO Server as soon as possible.
