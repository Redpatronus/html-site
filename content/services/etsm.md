#### Overview

Our External Threat & Security Monitoring service harnesses the power of OSINT to provide continuous, automated surveillance of publicly available data, ensuring your organization stays one step ahead of potential threats. By leveraging a suite of advanced OSINT tools—including Censys, Shodan, ProjectDiscovery, [SSlabs](https://github.com/matusso/libssllabs), our own fuzzing tools like Spotphish (part of [EagleOneX](/eox) [AI CySec Platform] project) and many more — we proactively detect and analyze vulnerabilities and risks that attackers might exploit.

#### How It Works
- Comprehensive Data Analysis: We gather and scrutinize public information from social media, forums, public databases, and more to understand what sensitive details are accessible to cyber adversaries.
- Proactive Threat Detection: Our system continuously monitors public services for signs of emerging threats, enabling rapid response to any potential security breaches.
- Actionable Insights: By analyzing the information attackers could use against you, we identify key focus areas for improving your security posture and implement robust security measures to mitigate risks.

#### Why Choose Our Service
