##### Red Team Engagements
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessments**:
Our red team simulates advanced cyber attacks to evaluate your IT infrastructure, applications, and networks. We adopt an external perspective to uncover hidden vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.
- **Attack Simulations & Post-Exploitation**:
Beyond initial penetration, we conduct post-exploitation exercises (using pre-approved scenarios) to demonstrate how an attacker might pivot within your environment and further compromise your systems.
- **Tailored Engagement Levels**:
Choose from black box, grey box, or white box testing approaches to align with your security needs and desired level of transparency.

##### Penetration Testing

Our penetration testing service involves simulated cyber attacks aimed at discovering security weaknesses before malicious actors do. Key features include:
- **Traditional IT Penetration Tests**:
Assessing systems, networks, and applications for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
###### AI Model Penetration Tests:
- **Input Manipulation Attacks**: Test the robustness of AI/ML models against manipulated inputs (e.g., images or text) designed to skew outcomes.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyze models to uncover sensitive information and intellectual property.
- **Data Poisoning**: Identify potential risks associated with inserting malicious data into training datasets, which can influence the model’s future behavior.

##### Phishing Campaign Simulations

Enhance your organization’s human firewall with our simulated phishing campaigns:
- **Realistic Attack Scenarios**:
We craft and send realistic, phishing-like emails and links to your employees to assess their ability to recognize and respond to suspicious communications.
- **Actionable Insights & Training**:
Post-campaign reports provide detailed insights into employee responses and areas for improvement, along with recommendations to boost overall security awareness.
